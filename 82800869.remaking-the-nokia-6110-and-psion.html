The actual number of pixels was more than 4x13, obviously, but resolutions back then were probably advertised to indicate how how many rows of contacts one could view at a time.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310</a></p><p>The Nokia 6110 and 3310 used an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM7#ARM7TDMI">ARM7TDMI </a> which TI made in their <a href="https://gadgetversus.com/processor/texas-instruments-mad2wd1-specs/">MAD2WD1</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png" width="675" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:28366,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe730b447-53f2-47dc-b67f-4027d8ef6c43_675x804.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This was Nokia’s first use of the ARM processor, which had a display for <em>applications</em>, like calendar, contacts, and snake.

The company released its first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_computer">pocket computer</a> in 1984: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit">8-bit</a> device named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Organiser">Psion Organiser</a>. In 1986 they released a series of improved models under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Organiser_II">Organiser II</a> brand, but the 8-bit era was ending. Psion saw a need to develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit">16-bit</a> operating system to drive their next generation of devices.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)#cite_note-Baxter-5">[5]</a> First, however, they needed to engineer a 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">single-board computer</a>, something that was extremely difficult at the time. They codenamed the project <em>SIBO</em>, for "single-board organiser" or "sixteen-bit organiser". To develop the SIBO hardware and software, they needed samples of the 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">microprocessors</a> they would be programming; but it took more than a year to secure the chips, which caused a significant delay.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)#cite_note-Baxter-5">[5]</a></p><p>By 1987, development of EPOC was underway: It was a single-user, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemptive_multitasking">preemptive multitasking</a> operating system designed to run in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">read-only memory</a> (ROM). The operating system and its programms were written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086">Intel 8086</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly language</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>. When the operating system started, it opened the pre-installed programmes in advance so that the system could switch between them quickly. To enable users to write and run their own programmes, EPOC featured an updated version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Programming_Language">Open Programming Language</a> (OPL), which was first published with the Psion Organiser. OPL was a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreted</a> language somewhat like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>.</p><p>In 1989, Psion released the first 16-bit computers to be equipped with the new operating system: the MC200 and MC400 notebooks. Each of these had an Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80C86">80C86</a> processor, but differed in some other specifications, such as memory capacity. Among the later SIBO devices were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion Series 3</a> (1991), 3A (1993), 3C (1996), Workabout series, and the Siena 512K model (1996).

<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63323263">power grid</a> was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/22/1130742768/ukraine-power-grid-outages-record-damage">seriously </a>damaged or out of service. Ukraine is considered a first-world country, yet it is not a thought that someone in a first world country wants to think or should have to think- that their energy security should all of a sudden become unpredictable. But that’s exactly what happened. Whether it is due to climate change, a natural disaster, or man-made, planning for resilient networks and infrastructure is common sense. The semi-conductor industry makes its highest margins on the leading node, the chips that go into the latest iPhone and Galaxy, but the revenue from this profit doesn’t always get reinvested into new and groundbreaking technologies, either because it does not benefit the market leader-it would cannibalize the sales of Intel i3 to sell a slower Celeron- which is why Intel discontinued the entry level line. AMD discontinued their Geode processor for similar reasons- the same processor found in the OLPC.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2"

While the slowest Atom processors weren’t able to run more modern OSes like Window 7 and YouTube very well, there was still a lot of potential for them for older operating systems. It took a couple more years to reach <a href="https://rhombus-tech.net/whitepapers/ecocomputing_07sep2015/#whatisgoodenoughcomputing">good enough</a> computing. By the time i3 processors were released and quad core Athlons, however, PCs could run many more apps and quite quickly with the advent of solid state drives, eliminating Disk I/O as a system bottleneck. </p><p>In <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=21723&amp;hilit=solar+powered+raspberry">2012 </a>I already hoped to start building a <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1785894&amp;hilit=solar+powered+adafruit#p1785894">solar powered laptop</a>. But at the time, the lowest powered application processors used over 5watts (5000 mW) of power. As recently as <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/10/2/16">2020</a>, research still mentions the Claremont, but it is unclear if Intel Labs has any research divisions dedicated to single core processors. The purpose of that demo was, apparently to demonstrate the capability of NTV, but now is used primarily for hyperscalers (HPC, which saves power). If a company like Intel back then realized that they could use that Claremont processor to build a Psion 3 with 256K, or a Nokia 6110-monochrome, not 24 bit color and extremely bright LED backlit display, they’d be able to build a modest, solar powered-phone with “instant-on” not just for the “third world”, but maybe one that could be used in Ukraine today to send text messages on wifi, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ham-radio-text-hacking">Teletype</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation#QRSS">Morse</a> <a href="https://www.i2phd.org/armradio/index.html">SDR</a>, LoReA, or LoRA <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html">over long distances</a> without power:</p><p>“Although the WiFi-standard was developed for short-distance data communication, its reach can be extended to cover distances of more than 100 kilometres.”</p><p>If the above link isn’t working, try this one <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html">https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html </a>(the “over long distances” link is a website powered by solar panels)</p><p>“The Spanish network is the largest WiFi-based long distance network in the world with more than 50,000 kilometres of links, although a small part is based on optic fibre links. Most of it is located in the Catalan Pyrenees, one of the least populated areas in Spain. The network was initiated in 2004 and now has close to 30,000 nodes, up from 17,000 in 2012. <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html#fn:8">8</a><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html#fn:22">22</a>”</p><p>“However, the low-tech networks that distribute internet access to a large user base in developing countries can have much more limited bandwidth per user. For example, a university campus in Kerala (India) uses a 750 kbps internet connection that is shared across 3,000 faculty members and students operating from 400 machines, where during peak hours nearly every machine is being used.</p><p>Therefore, the worst-case average bandwidth available per machine is approximately 1.9 kbps, which is slow even in comparison to a dial-up connection (56 kbps). And this can be considered a really good connectivity compared to typical rural settings in poor countries. <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html#fn:26">26</a> To make matters worse, such networks often have to deal with an intermittent power supply.”</p><p>The article goes on to explain lots of local solutions to that so it is not all pessimistic (If you were already thinking at 750Kbps that it was slow, you were maybe born after 2000, or haven’t seen what you can do with 1.9kbps, or both)</p><p>Let’s say that instead of using a GSM network (Ukraine has 2G in many places), because there could be an event that caused it to be down (manmade or natural disaster), an ad-hoc wifi network as the one above is implemented. Then, local routers subdivide the signal further and are able to transmit some of the network (maybe not bidirectionally everywhere but at least in a round-about manner). The solar phone isn’t able to use SMS, but may be able to use bluetooth over internet and wifi, with solar powered relay beacons providing the network throughout a city. Even with a small data rate of 1.9kbps, you can have an XMPP protocol or IRC channel sending data in very small packets. The equivalent in text messages is<a href="http://Text Message Bits and Bytes SMS text messages use 7-bit characters and have a maximum length of 160 characters, making the maximum data size of each SMS 1120 bits, or 140 bytes."> 140 bytes:</a> <br>”Text Message Bits and Bytes</p><p>SMS text messages use 7-bit characters and have a maximum length of 160 characters, making the maximum data size of each SMS 1120 bits, or 140 bytes.” </p><p>If a router is used by 45 users (the maximum recommended, even if an off the shelf router can theoretically handle up to <a href="http://www.fusionconnect.com/blog/too-many-devices-on-wifi-how-to-identify-and-correct-limited-wifi-connections#:~:text=How%20many%20devices%20can%20connect,250%20devices%20connected%20at%20once.">250</a>), and a 802.11g access point is only able to pick up a 85.5Kbps signal, those users would also have only a 1.9kbps signal.  1.9kbps is 237 bytes per second. That means that a 160 character text message could be sent every second (if you can type that fast), and if the headers and packet sizes are not large. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT </a>uses a low-packet size. What kind of data could be sent? Your location, if you need help; request for food or water, and where one can go. Practically anything one would send in an emergency. Better something descriptive than a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS">SOS </a>signal, especially if many other signals are being sent co-localized and not much more sense can be made

By just listening for a pending data indication, eDRX uses less power than if it made a full network connection, so this process helps preserve the device’s power. The time needed for this listening process is also much shorter than the time it takes to make a full network connection.</p><p>The maximum sleep time for eDRX devices range from up to 43 minutes for devices using LTE-M LPWA networks, to up to three hours for devices using NB-IoT LPWA networks. The minimum sleep time can be as short as 320 milliseconds (ms) for LTE-M and 10.24 seconds for NB-IoT.”</p><p>I’ll take it! Add it to my tab, waiter.

Putting them on calculators showed off how inexpensively the panels could be made and how little energy was needed for the processors to function.</p><p>This kind of display of technological achievement was fairly standard in consumer products at the time.</p><p>“When Texas Instruments wanted to push the then-new transistor, they chose the radio as first blockbuster application,” says Joerg Werner, who maintains the <a href="http://www.datamath.org/">Datamath Calculator Museum</a> online.</p><p>Werner points out that the earliest computer chips followed a similar path, going from rockets to pockets and wrists (<a href="http://ethw.org/Milestones:Commercialization_and_Industrialization_of_Photovoltaic_Cells,_1959#The_World.E2.80.99s_First_PV-Installed_Calculator_and_Watch">perhaps you had a cool solar LCD watch to go with your sun-powered calculator</a>).</p><p>The first solar calculators had their disadvantages: The Sun Man’s solar panels were on the back and the Teal Photon, which came two years later, needed bright light to operate. But by the early ‘80s, Sharp and Texas Instruments had developed solar panels that could run under low or artificial light. This pushed solar and the attached low-cost calculators, firmly and finally, into the mainstream.</p><p>One Texas Instruments promotion in 1984 gave free solar calculators to businesses that bought TI computers. A few years later, Chicago Public Schools paid $1.1 million for 167,000 solar TI calculators to use in classrooms. A 1989 trend-watching column declared solar calculators “in” and astrology “out” (the same column declared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCja1WGZx-E">Morris the Cat</a> in and Kitty Dukakis out). </p><p><em>Newsweek</em> referenced solar calculators in 1990 to explain what solar panels were, while a column in the <em>St. Petersburg Times </em>predicted,“You'll be seeing a lot more new solar products on the shelves in the coming year,” including devices for scaring away backyard moles and charging car batteries.</p><p>The technology that made tiny, efficient calculators possible also brought us mobile phones, personal computers, Game Boys, Tamagotchis, and Furbys in just a few years—minus the solar cells. Some of these devices needed small, constant streams of power to maintain their memories, and others just used a lot of juice, as anyone who tried to beat Link’s Awakening on a long car trip surely knows.</p><p>And while solar calculators continue to outsell non-solar models for Texas Instruments, kids who stick with math class often move on to TI-89s and other graphing calculators. These are great for calculus and trigonometry, but they’re too powerful to run on solar.</p><p>Instead, solar moved to less-visible places, like the lights and signs on highways. As they get more efficient, solar panels are increasingly showing up not just in large-scale arrays, but on house rooftops and parking lot canopies. If Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/energy/2015/05/150501-tesla-home-battery-grid-energy-storage/">plans work out</a>, we’ll all have batteries to store solar power for our homes.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean children of the ‘80s, ‘90s, and today are all rushing to make their houses as green as their calculators. Solar calculators may have convinced a generation that the sun could power gadgets, but it’s not the same as convincing them that the power in tiny calculators could stream from an outlet.</p><p>The problem, says professor and futurist Cindy Frewen, is that people don’t necessarily think of rooftop panels the same way they might think of consumer electronics. "People adopt their gadgets, but they accept their energy,” she says. “They take it for granted: ‘This is what I have in my house.</p><p>That might change as utilities and clean energy companies offer more consumer-friendly options for solar panels and batteries to go with them like Tesla’s Powerwall, a battery designed by and for technophiles.</p><p>The next generation may not even expect to plug their gadgets into a grid.

He had first formulated and patented such an idea while he lived in London in 1933 <strong>after reading Ernest Rutherford's</strong> <strong>disparaging </strong>remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium.” :</p><p>“However, a speech of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford#Nuclear_physics">Rutherford's</a> about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed on 12 September 1933 London paper <em>The Times</em>, was reported by Szilárd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing nuclear chain reaction. Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day.</p><p>Rutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton in "splitting" lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of <strong>light elements remains too inefficient</strong> to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford's speech in part, read:</p><blockquote><p>We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a <strong>very poor and inefficient way of producing energy</strong>, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford#cite_note-50">[50]</a></p></blockquote><p>The moral of the story: when a scientist says that some thing (e.g matter/energy) is insignificant, a competing scientist, driven by knowledge, curiosity, or both, is motivated enough to test that statement.

In 1977, The Voyager 1 spacecraft was launched to explore interstellar space. Included was a phonograph record, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record">Voyager Golden Record</a> containing “records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form who may find them. The records are a time capsule.”</p><p>If you were Carl Sagan and wanted to know if extraterrestrial life existed, a Golden Record would be a logical idea to send into space. He once, said, "The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet."</p><p>If you’re not like Carl Sagan, you’re probably not very hopeful. The Golden Record may seem symbolic, but isn’t it practical? Even if there is no life found outside of Earth, the pursuit of science exists because some choose to believe that by testing a hypothesis, they no may no longer need to say, “I didn’t try so I’ll never know” What that means is, while there are some who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files">want to believe</a> just for the sake of believing, the scientist is neither a skeptic nor an optimist, but a realist by testing nature. A agnostic person can be hopeful for an outcome, but a bias cannot exist. Theodore von Kármán once said, "Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been." When one is not studying, they are creating. </p><p>That sounds all nice and dandy, but there’s more. The “planets” metaphor is sometimes used with people. There is certainly the reality that some cultures want to be remain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples">uncontacted</a>. And <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/book/5200">others</a>, for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ct/qtac014">other</a> reasons. Cultural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-cultural_diffusion">diffusion </a>includes technology. The uptake of technology is not always a top-down phenomena. Yet there is often a tendency for technology to be rejected regardless of it source. The technological change that engineering is focused on is less on direct-to-consumer, who may be non-technical and unaware of the direct applications of new technology, often used in arcane specialties with little to no observable immediate benefit. Thus out of each class of engineers, is one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33IvVreU3Ow">everyman</a>, who is <a href="https://youtu.be/XN3hJ4K9hCs?t=81">not from</a> a long line of priestly families, who learns the ways of high priests, first out of curiosity, and then for the vernacular.  When you’re teaching a foreigner, or selling a product, aren’t you trading in Golden Records?</p><p>“If I could explain it to the average person, I wouldn’t have been worth</p><p>the Nobel Prize. -Richard Feynman”</p><p>Fortunately, some <a href="https://realizeengineering.blog/everyday-engineering-examples/">educators </a>are aware of this gap between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures">Two Cultures</a>:</p><p> "Educators tend to describe engineering concepts in language and using examples that are unfamiliar to students starting out on their students. Research has shown that present[ing] engineering principles in a context that is familiar [to] students improves their understanding, helps recruitment and retention, and leads to higher ratings for professors."</p><h3>Encore</h3><p>David Bowie once described the Internet in 1999 as “an alien life form:”<br></p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/i/status/1588946147170988032&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;The always missed DAVID BOWIE predicting back in 1999 - with typical prescience - the impact of the Internet on all of us.\n\n &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;MichaelWarbur17&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Michael Warburton&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Nov 05 17:27:37 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/upload/w_1028,c_limit,q_auto:best/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_88/uuxc5jqsftfgbkhicxoh&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/RFs2D8GDBo&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:1462,&quot;like_count&quot;:5936,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1321442203726684161/vid/720x720/d9hnEDIjz-WCD1tW.mp4?tag=13&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1588946147170988032" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/MichaelWarbur17.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @MichaelWarbur17" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Michael Warburton </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@MichaelWarbur17</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">The always missed DAVID BOWIE predicting back in 1999 - with typical prescience - the impact of the Internet on all of us.

As Arthur Clarke once said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” The internet isn’t being compared directly to magic, but rather in that it was not immediately apparent in the early days of ARPAnet nor in 1999 to something so ubiquitous as as the IPv6 address system soon became needed.</p><p>In other words, the internet is like an alien life form, <em>by other means</em>. It is sufficiently weird, that the weird became the <em>pros</em>.</p><p>So, Bowie deserves some credit, which is why I will name a new semiconductor law to him, which I call Bowie’s Law. I previously wrote a guideline <a href="https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/wiki/tri-design-approach.md">here</a>. It states that for every solar powered mobile computer (MC), there is an equally eerie extra-terrestrial energy efficient-equivalent, which can be written MC=E^5 (one E was not counted because equivalent is hyphenated, and somewhat redundant)</p><p>This energy efficiency of a mobile computer requires that the TDP (thermal design power limit) not exceed the extra-terrestrial energy source (namely the sun) in ambient conditions- e.g low to average lumen levels) that is able to reach that device. In other words, for a typical phone or laptop that uses an earth-based energy source, the power consumption usually exceeds what a small solar panel beside it would be able to generate, often by a large margin.

Once you eat those,<em> then you get to eat the steak.</em>” That “steak” today is the full fat modern operating systems like Android and iOS. And the salad is the Nokia 6110. The 1990s phone is the lean payload of the 2022 equivalent, if only because feature development has become inextricably linked to platforms now deliberately ignorant  of energy-autarkic design. Another, albeit confusing analogy would be- the voice and text feature is the main course meal, and the games/idle browsing is the dessert. Thus anyone who seriously wanted to develop a solar powered phone or PDA should set more modest software goals for the short term, while emphasizing the benefits of solar hardware in future releases. </p><h3>I am the Cargo Cult</h3><p>One does not get to become Steve Jobs by developing an Iphone.

An lo and behold, people could walk over water! jk. But they intuitively understood what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP </a>was. They didn’t need a 700 page Unix technical manual to tell them how to develop/use software after unboxing. So I present to you a new general purpose technology. The nametag sized solar panel. It intuitively works! By holding it up or placing it on a flat surface, it passively collects sunlight and the PMIC does all the power management. Make room on your PCB &amp; chassis, please. Because there are many solar panel deniers. There are unbelievers. Maybe if ARPA-E could develop a vertically integrated (yet open, modular and interoperable hardware) mobile phone, tablet, and laptop with a solar panel, you might have have believers, in the hinterlands, who will not view Silicon Valley so much a place of coastal elitism if only they could get a piece of the technology. However, cultural adoption of solutions, such as vaccines, are not always met with open <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/01/science-technology-vaccine-invention-history/672227/">triceps</a>. For all the other believers, they are already queuing at landing strips, chanting for the next cargo drop. Make The White House Solar again. Oh, wait they already put them back on in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/solar-panels-white-house/">2002</a>. Well, we put a man on the moon before, so we can also put a solar panel back on a laptop… ;)</p><p><em>“There is no end. There is no beginning.

Perhaps this idea of inverting the concept of devices that run on battery power to run on local generation is so radical, because no one ever thought of adding up the power consumption numbers of all the components, something only accountants do in other fields. I don’t consider this idea that <em><strong>bold.</strong></em> The idea to redesign an entire computer and promote innovative technologies is exactly what the CHIPS act is trying to promote, but I think it’s not explicitly supporting the small startups. It’s supporting those who can continue to make more powerful chips that use the same energy- Dennard’s scaling. The amount of display selection is dominated by emissive, relatively high power consumption backlit screens. Reflective displays like <a href="https://www.azumotech.com/">Azumo </a>somewhat innovative and niche, but attempt to limit the backlight and instead add a front light. </p><p>“The AEMLIC charges the capacitor up to 3.78V and the output is enabled down to 2.49V. If your application draws 30mA from the 3.3V output, then it will run for: 250F<em>(3.78V-2.49V)</em>90%/0.03A= 10750s = 2.7 hrs” A display that runs at less than 9mA and an MCU that runs at 1mA could thus last over 8 hrs (not counting inputs or wireless).</p><h3><strong>Indoor Series&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>LL200-2.4-37</strong></p><p><strong>1000 lux:</strong></p><ul><li><p>0.462mW</p></li><li><p>0.220mA</p></li><li><p>2.1V</p></li></ul><p><strong>200 lux:</strong></p><ul><li><p>0.07W</p></li><li><p>0.044mA</p></li><li><p>1.6V</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Classic Application</strong></h3><p><strong>MPT2.4-21</strong></p><p><strong>100% Sun</strong></p><ul><li><p>32mW</p></li><li><p>14.2mA</p></li><li><p>2.4V</p></li></ul><p><strong>25% Sun</strong></p><ul><li><p>7.7mW</p></li><li><p>3.2mA</p></li><li><p>2.4V</p></li></ul><p>from <a href="https://www.powerfilmsolar.com/products/development-kits/solar-development-kit-with-e-peas-pmic-cap-xx-supercapacitors">https://www.powerfilmsolar.com/products/development-kits/solar-development-kit-with-e-peas-pmic-cap-xx-supercapacitors</a></p><p>See also: <a href="https://www.powerfilmsolar.com/products/development-kits/solar-development-kit">https://www.powerfilmsolar.com/products/development-kits/solar-development-kit</a></p><p>So what else is available? No, not OLED. Something like 2.7” SHARP Memory in Pixel, or 4.4” <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/lpm044m141a/japan-display-inc">Japan Display</a> (maybe one day we can get 17” screens that run on 5mW, I hear ya). Other displays like discontinued Epson TFD displays use 3mW for 1.9”- potentially good enough for a phone. The advantage of these displays is that they are not so slow of a refresh as e-paper but also provide clear and non-glared reflective surfaces in sunlight, like the Pixel Qi display (defunct). This is a desire to offer consumers more display types, not just <em>faster </em>refresh rates. 60Hz, 120Hz <a href="https://github.com/hatonthecat/Soap-Kernel">240Hz </a>appear to imitate some vague notion of progress*,<strong> </strong>but there can be also lower refresh rates do not depend on highly interactive information. That is, more displays should be designed to display static information, and use less power to display that. One of those ways is to use <a href="https://focuslcds.com/journals/bistable-lcd-display-technology/">bistable</a> <a href="https://www.newvisiondisplay.com/what-are-zbd-lcds/">displays</a>, as seen in epaper and other <a href="https://www.gtk.co.uk/products/displays/mono-displays/bi-stable">screens</a>. </p><h3>It’s not minimalism, but counter-maximalism</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximalism">Maximalism </a>has been identified in the humanities such as literature by Joyce’s <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em>, Delillo’s <em>White Noise</em>, David Foster Wallace’s <em>Infinite Jest</em>, which were satirical uses of Maximalism, rather than blind acceptance of it. The design of technology is not viewed with the same critical rigor. Features are packed into an omnibus of an operating system, and hardware is designed around it. However, the operating systems of today are actually built on an hardware with an expectation of abundant transistors. A modern computer has more transistors on a single chip than the the number of humans on earth. The awareness and reaction of this trend, is what is called “software-defined hardware.” In the past (1970s-90s) hardware was the limiting factor, thus hardware defined the amount of software. When RAM prices decreased (though not immediately after Taiwan’s 1999 Jiji <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Jiji_earthquake">earthquake</a>), hardware ceased to be the limiting factor. But now that less expensive hardware no longer limits software, one previous component which was given secondary or tertiary priority, power, can now be used to return to constrained hardware that can fit exactly one or a handful of apps, due to the power reduction of each generation of transistor node process.</p><h4>The 1984 Macintosh was a simplification of the mainframe and a GUI</h4><p></p><p>“&nbsp;Until now, Woz had dealt with electronics as a hardware exercise. You had a problem to be solved and you did so using some configuration of the hardware tools of electronics: the old linear devices like capacitors, oscillators, resistors; discrete devices of more recent vintage like diodes; and the new digital integrated circuits, including ROMs, RAMs and TTL logic. The obvious difficulty in this method--the only method the engineering world had known until recently--was that the more complex the problem, the more complicated the hardware setup needed to address it. In this world, the most gifted engineers were those who could puzzle out novel ways to reduce the number of components by, say, 10 percent. And it was in this particular type of simplification that Woz had shown almost supernatural talent.”</p><p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/malone-loop.html">from</a> https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/malone-loop.html</p><h3>More than a spectacle, less than a nebulae</h3><p> In this way, it is software defined hardware, for the sake of allowing solar powered/autarkic devices, rather than the arbitrary or Houdini-like mysteriousness of creating challenges that make product ideas appear to be a spectacle, when they are rather, an efficient way of single-tasking user interfaces, for the sake of improving one’s attention span.</p><h3>        Also sprach Houdini: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg" width="421" height="636.6121428571429" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2117,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:421,&quot;bytes&quot;:274398,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00462e22-976d-4cd5-a01a-008de59fb868_1400x2117.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>So, by instead designing every single part of the phone running even at 100% CPU utilization (with a maximum speed of perhaps 100MHz), it can use less power than the amount of power generated per second in ambient light. Isn’t there a calculus term for that, like derivative or something? That’s right- the differential at a point on a slope. The rate of power consumption SHALL NOT exceed the rate of power generation. <em>Ideally</em>. Some amount of fuzzy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">logic </a>has to have some kind of utility here, right? But sometimes the generation will create a harvest when idling, and that can be used for longer durations. And sometimes the consumption will exceed available light. No matter how hard one tried to stress test the power consumption, the system shall be designed to never use more than what could be generated by a window sill from 8am-4pm.

And this is especially true from the standpoint of someone who hears about a new tool: it's going to be more viral if a) it spreads by being useful, and b) it spreads in as many different groups as possible, i.e. it has lots of use cases.”</p><h3>The Little Solar Power Plant that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Engine-That-Could-Anniversary/dp/0593094395/ref=asc_df_0593094395/?tag=&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=416638939404&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9611863681704712622&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9021875&amp;hvtargid=pla-902408980532&amp;psc=1&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=93867144197&amp;asin=0593094395&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1">Could</a></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg" width="1456" height="1127" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1127,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2333799,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5702d89-e5cf-410d-b723-05e4f195acab_1962x1518.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h6>Look Ma!

I’m glad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera_Motors">Aptera </a>built a partially/fully solar powered electric car (depending on how many miles a day you drive). Perhaps one day they will adopt iron-air batteries with 10x the density, since lithium mining is unsustainable. I was talking about Aptera as an unaffiliated, volunteer brand ambassador in 2010, promoting rooftop charging of electric cars to anyone who would listen, and people on a forum were telling me it was impossible. I think back to that Rutherford statement of too “inefficient.” People wanted to sell me lead-acid batteries when I wanted something greener, and told me to go tell it on a rooftop, and so I did, and I met James Baldwin there. We chatted a bit. You know what? Don’t you think it’s ironic that we have a solar powered car now and not a solar powered laptop or phone? One that can charge several miles a day parked in a sunny parking lot from 8AM-4PM in a corporate parking lot. Discontinuous charging allows asynchronous use of power via a battery, rather than the mindset that solar should be instantaneously capable of powering a motor. This mentality stems out of instant gratification, where patience should be a virtue. So I don’t want to make the same mistake again, finding myself talking to people who say something is impossible, since one day, in 2033, perhaps, there may be startup saying <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/windows-7-was-my-idea-no-really-it-was/">they first</a></em> thought of the the solar phone, and that they should be funded, when I’m one of the first to believe it’s possible.  It’s not patents that I seek; it’s the thought that counts. Though I don’t really seek to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist">tech-evangelist</a>. Because I understand my tone isn’t positive. If anything, my tech-evangelism will hopefully lead to another tech evangelist picking up the slack sooner rather than later. It would also be nice if they(you?) could give me a heads up before they(you?) go on stage with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcjLEwZqcQI">iRack</a>.</p><p>So my scrutiny towards the semiconductor innovation/stagnation is much higher than the ironically and debatably greener automotive startups, when there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus">cognitive surplus</a> for idle tweeting but not a utilization of passive mobile devices harvesting energy while someone is waiting at a bus stop. Sure there’s Bell Labs and Intel Labs, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797">Idea Factory </a>is way past its heyday, although one would hope that Nokia is doing something revolutionary.  I’ve wanted to apply, but I don’t feel like I fit in anything. I feel like the open source “community” should tackle moon shot projects like this. They should be the ones building something bigger than any single company, and focus on a standard platform: <a href="https://semiengineering.com/is-ucie-really-universal/">https://semiengineering.com/is-ucie-really-universal/</a>:</p><p>“<strong>The journey<br></strong>Today, everyone creating a package that includes multiple dies is designing everything. They have full control over the PHY layer and the protocols they use for communications. It doesn’t really matter if they fully conform to any of the standards. They only need compatibility between their own dies.</p><p>“The third-party target market is like <strong>Plato’s ideal world</strong>,” says Ilyadis. “That’s the point where you have interoperability, plug and play, between devices. It requires having a packaging technology that is more accessible. It needs to be democratized so smaller companies have access. But it’s a journey.””</p><p>That’s the issue- a platform isn’t really universal if you can’t get to an agreement.

What am I talking about 10%?  from this <a href="https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2186/2062">article</a>:</p><p>“As we have explained, in a market economy goods will be produced when only those who paid for them can consume their benefits. However, when benefits accrue to people other than the buyer of the good the producer will have less incentive to produce more goods. This forms the crux of the software dialectic. Free software favours inclusion rather than exclusion but for the market to provide goods it must be possible to exclude “free riders” from sharing in the benefits of a good.”</p><p>If open hardware built a standard laptop, and then someone dumpster dives and finds a chassis with no case, you have someone who can put together a new laptop, because some thoughtless person decided the plastic was worthless and yet when that chassis is not standardized, that dumpster diver can’t install a SBC motherboard in their laptop and carry it around like a cool person. They have to make do with a bunch of hardware that doesn’t fit, all because FSF and Open Source can’t work towards a common cause- the environment. The person might be taking a train and has to stuff a Raspberry pi in their bag because their chassis is an empty heap of plastic (e.g. Pi Top v2). if Rpi makes a Rpi5 and some other SBC makes one, I am curious if they are going to still duke it out while landfills in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agbogbloshie">Agbogbloshie</a> pile up with plastic cases.</p><div><hr></div><p>So back to what I was saying. Early linux 2.4 perhaps. Sure, there are lots of people who can use a command line interface. I have used sudo apt get install __ hundreds of times, but that doesn’t make me a programmer. My point is, developing a GUI-based OS, for solar powered CPUS, will allow more people to use linux on a mobile device. They can learn command line later, if they choose. Not everyone gets into the world of programming by purchasing an expensive general purpose CPU, nor should they. This type of computer could be used in cafes without ample outlets for charging, on 8 hour bus rides in third world countries that don’t yet have outlets like first world countries do. So you have a basic interactive typewriter that outputs information based on programming inputs. This is experiential based learning, and more productive than a text book-like e-reader. Thus if one had a quiz app, where a user is memorizing programming commands with rote exercises, or something like Thonny, they could learn programming without needing a high speed internet connection. This can be useful in areas where large exercises can be downloaded for offline use. And thus developers can be productive, even in the absence of a more RAM intensive IDE. Thonny uses 39MB, too much for a microcontroller, but perhaps not too much for a 64MB RAM SBC in a serial task-based OS (one that doesn’t allow tabbed windows or apps, but the ability to save one’s work if toggling between apps on microSD storage), which I believe would help with assisting users with attention span as well.</p><h3>Revisiting OLPC</h3><p>Just for a minute, let’s suggest that phones are not computers. First, are phones a computer? I would say yes and no. A phone doesn’t always need to be a computer, and it’s best that they are a phone first.  </p><p> In  Ben Morris’s “The Symbian OS Architecture Sourcebook,” (2007) Chapter 1 “Why Phones are Different,” a brief history of mobile phones and technological convergence, along with some key points why phones are different- it is their complexity:   </p><p>“Mobile phones are different from other devices for many reasons and</p><p>most of those reasons make them more complex too.</p><p>• Mobile phones are multi-function devices.</p><p>•Mobile phone functionality is expanding at an exponential rate.</p><p>•Phone-related technologies are evolving at an exponential rate.</p><p>•Mobile phones are enmeshed in a complex and still evolving business model.</p><p>•Mobile phones are highly personal consumer devices (even when</p><p>someone else pays for them)</p><p>In a word, the mobile phone difference is ‘complexity’ and the trend</p><p>towards complexity appears to be growing at an exponential pace.”<br></p><p>“Device convergence is not a hypothesis, it is the reality. As discussed</p><p>above, mobile phones have cannibalized the PDA market, appear to have</p><p>eroded the digital camera market, and threaten other markets including</p><p>the personal music-player market.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

product in mind when he set out to develop the OLPC. The OLPC laptop was certainly influential, in that it inspired many developers to bridge access to technology, but it had some major flaws, as has already been covered in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now">press </a>and in books like “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537445/the-charisma-machine/">The Charisma Machine</a>,” by Morgan Ames. </p><p>"Ames reveals that the laptops were not only frustrating to use, easy to break, and hard to repair, they were designed for “technically precocious boys”—idealized younger versions of the developers themselves—rather than the children who were actually using them." </p><p>In Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Solaris </em>2002 adaptation by Stephen Soderbergh, there is a line,</p><p>“We're proud of ourselves.<br>But when you think about it,<br>our enthusiasm's a sham.<br>We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.”</p><p>If you were confused by what I meant by Golden Records, <em>Solaris </em>shows that space exploration is more like space colonization. When a product is sold without any consideration to its users, it becomes a projection of ones own desires, as seen in the OLPC. It’s wrong to assume that everyone is precocious, but it’s also wrong to assume that no one is precocious.</p><p>Today, desktop PC and laptop usage is a minority of electronic communication devices. By comparison, a recent <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">estimate</a> places 91% of the world’s population as an owner of a cell phone (this includes both smartphones and feature phones). If one only counted smartphones (devices with more than a handful of apps like Snake, Calender, Contacts, and a calculator), the number decreases to 83.32%. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png" width="1207" height="1329" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1329,&quot;width&quot;:1207,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:205136,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4f86f7-b3b6-4318-b3b6-4b9a97da258f_1207x1329.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Negroponte’s words weren’t the gentlest, either: </p><p>“And Negroponte was losing interest in hardware. After he <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395763,00.asp">outlined a dramatic</a> (and ultimately metaphorical) plan to drop tablets out of helicopters, the OLPC Foundation distributed mass-market Motorola Xoom tablets in two Ethiopian villages as a new experiment. In 2012, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves/">it reported</a> that children had learned the alphabet within two weeks, and within five months, they had “hacked Android” — which referred to turning off software that disabled the camera. As Android phones and tablets became more sophisticated, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493583/computer-hardware/olpc-cancels-xo-3-tablet--downplays-need-for-new-hardware.html">Negroponte abandoned</a> development of an OLPC solar-powered XO-3 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/8/2691733/olpc-xo-3-0-tablet-pictures-video">tablet</a>. He joined the newly founded Global Literacy XPrize soon after, effectively putting OLPC behind him.”</p><p>From PC Mag link above, quoting Negroponte after an Open Mobile Summit on November 2, 2011, he doubled down: “"We will literally take tablets and drop them out of helicopters," and return a year later to see if the effort was a success, Negroponte said. A new tablet design can withstand a 30-foot drop, and even be left out in the rain.</p><p>"When I say no people, I mean absolutely no people," he added, when asked if he was serious. "When I say I drop out of the helicopters, I mean it... it's like a Coke bottle falling out of the sky," he said, apparently referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Must_Be_Crazy">1982 movie, </a><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Must_Be_Crazy">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a></em>. In that movie, however, a bushman is convinced that the Coke bottle's embodiment of the concept of property is evil, and leaves his village to dispose of it.”</p><p>One of the points the narrator in the 1982 movie makes is that because there is only coke bottle, there is not enough to share, and it creates problems and conflict. But as mentioned above, 91% of the world owns a phone. Whether it is reliable is another issue, but one solar aims to address. The futurist or utopian belief of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy">post-scarcity </a>economy, even in the face of an earth with dwindling resources, is a reaction to real or perceived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity">artificial scarcity</a>.</p><p>According to a quote from earlier that year, in June 2011 at the Social Innovation Summit, OLPC News, Wayan Vota says,</p><p>“And yet he is still talking about dropping XO laptops from the sky. Just listen to him at the United Nations <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/06/social-innovation-summit-2011-part-1.html">Social Innovation Summit 2011</a> at around the 1 hour mark:</p><p>“So you've got a hundred and fifty to two hundred million kids [not going to first grade], and so here's the question: Can you, either literally or metaphorically, drop out of a helicopter, which is exactly what we plan to do, with tablets into village, where there is no school, but there's kids, at least eight to ten kids?<br><br>And then go back a year later - are they reading? And if the answer is yes, that would be transformational. Then people might pay more attention. And then it would apply to places where there are schools, so on and so forth.”</p><p> Thus, Negroponte may have corrected himself before the emphasis was placed on the metaphorical in the 2018 Verge’s article, but he was at least open to the idea at sometime before the November PC Mag stating only the literal.</p><p>In any case, dropping anything out of a plane is not a great idea. A one time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dumbo_Drop">Dumbo drop</a> should not be an expensive design feature if there are less impersonal delivery methods, but leaves too much of an impression that the machines are designed for surviving impact, rather than surviving its users. But while I’m on the topic, anything dropped from a plane or helicopter should have a parachute, or fall out like a swarm of biomimetic bats so as not to injure someone below. What if The OLPC was instead a One-Phone Per Person project? That is, each individual could receive a solar powered phone?</p><p> I think of that phrase:</p><p>Like the old saying, "Give a person a fish, you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you'll feed him for a lifetime. “</p><p>Give a person a laptop, in a rural village with no running electricity, and he'll run out of battery in a day. Give a person a solar powered phone, he'll never need a USB or Lightning charger again.</p><p>“Negroponte, who <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_negroponte_on_one_laptop_per_child/transcript?language=en">delivered the very first TED talk</a> in 1984 and co-founded the MIT Media Lab in 1985, envisioned a program that would bridge both the access and usage divides. In a 2006 TED talk, he shared a personal anecdote from a remote village in Cambodia:</p><p>“…a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. And these kids, their first English word is “Google” and they only know Skype. They’ve never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night—they ‘ve got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn’t have electricity. The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it’s the brightest light source in the house.”</p><p>This ideal can be contrasted with the costs of maintaining a solar network-<a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/hardware/power_supply/olpc_nigeria_electricty_cost.html"> </a><em><strong><a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/hardware/power_supply/olpc_nigeria_electricty_cost.html">in 2006</a>:</strong></em></p><p>“$5,000 - 15KVa electricity generator<br>$3,000 - VSAT dish<br>$50 - WiFi access points<br>$100 - electrical wiring of the classrooms<br>$600 - solar panels<br>$250 - gang charger<br><strong>$9,000”</strong></p><p>Pardon my <a href="https://www.milwaukeemag.com/this-show-is-set-in-milwaukee-and-its-hilarious/">M’waukeean </a>accent, but that’s fizzed up, like <em>soda</em>!</p><p>By contrast, Solar Low Tech Magazine, as linked above (but <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html">here again</a>) describes that the means to build a solar network not rest on expensive solar charging equipment. Once mass production of solar-autarkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit#Application-specific_standard_product">ASSP</a>s can be developed, the infrastructure to maintain a decentralized WAN would be significantly reduced. Instead of all internet bandwidth travelling through large centralized towers, a backup network dedicated just for vital communications could be installed in parallel wherever infrastructure can support it. An option to limit bandwidth to “essential” texts and minimum data packages could guarantee some form of a social safety net, in terms of access to job bulletins, marketplace negotiations, and other kinds of communications that would not necessarily require expensive cell towers to relay. A village that doesn’t need a large cell tower might be able to install a small 200-400 watt solar panel with a battery capable of running a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/new-router-firmware-safely-opens-your-wi-fi-network-to-strangers/">community</a>-<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/04/open-wireless-movement">shared</a>, mutually distrustful, high throughput <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/the-4g-mobile-internet-thats-already-there.html">router </a>capable of tens of thousand of SMS-like and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a> connections per day, using advanced QoS techniques that limits all non-essential internet use, and and costing less than $400 worth of equipment. A used 200watt solar panel can be had for less than $100, while a LiFePO4 battery capable of running a router at 10-20watts for 24 hrs at 100 % utilization may run over $100, while solar charge controllers and DC-based routers, or an inexpensive inverter should be the most basic unit of a wifi network. The goal here is low-tech: not low-tech in the Neanderthal sense (that would be an insult to Neanderthals), but high-tech in the relativistic emphasis on 2D GUIS with text-based communication over graphically accelerated, multimedia-centric operating systems. Thus 90’s era communication should be a goal post that remains stable until resilient, autarkic infrastructure can be delivered for worldwide access. Then, and only then, should the goal posts be moved towards 3D and more graphically demanding hardware- Most people would prefer to have a feature phone over nothing at all, but surely there are some that would snub at the idea. I do not view this concept as a charity, but rather an opt-in platform, since it’s likely many will continue to prefer to use battery-or outlet dependent devices.</p><p>Can the 91% of the world with a phone be considered a globalized cohort? Does the fact that 91% of the world owns a phone signify that humanity has some shared acceptance that technology is not some anti-traditional disruptive innovation? I don’t really concern myself with those questions very often. I view solar phones not as a one-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_fix">techno-solutionism</a>, as some critics of a technological fix might suggest, but rather a de-emphasis on technologies that should have been transitioned away decades ago, but for <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-solar-panel.html">various </a>reasons- political, economic, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car">otherwise</a>, were not.</p><p>“The technological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies. It now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap, quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies; these fixes often create more problems than they solve, or give people a sense that they have solved the problem.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_fix#cite_note-3">[3]</a>”</p><p>In the past, research funding for projects like the OLPC seemed to flow much more freely. Would a project like this be granted funding today, if MIT or some other organization had a 2nd chance? Why should a new generation of idealists who grew up with solar calculators be denied the chance to one-up a flawed plan that relied on only on 2005 era transistors? When the exascale computers at national labs were planned years in <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2022/05/30/the-final-frontier-us-has-its-first-exascale-supercomputer/">advance</a>, more than 10 years <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~skeckler/pubs/SC_2014_Exascale.pdf">ago</a>, claiming a 20MW TDP, they were done with consultation with the leading foundries. The OLPC used what was currently available. Thus, the MIT approach looks Quixotic in retrospect (though admirable, as Don Quixote said he preferred to ride on a donkey instead of horse to remain lower to the height of people in <em>Man of La Mancha</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha_(film)">1972</a>), obviously to keep an ear to the ground, and the will of his constituents). Thus, I take the exascale approach towards solar powered computers- the long view. The actual figure of 20MW is arbitrary, and not being compared for the sake of consumption, but the fact that some projects announce a TDP goal at all. This design consideration is equally crucial for philanthropic or community funded initiatives. Anything less than setting a TDP would appear to support <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyWVaZsUQjc">vested</a> interests. If the OLPC continued their development and licensed AMD’s Geode on 32nm at reduced speed (200mhz, with a low-ram OS), would they still have all the issues with charging the devices on 100% solar  in say 2015? Probably not. But they’d be a lot closer to arriving there had they stayed the course. Now it seems politically incorrect to renew interest in it. And I seek to find out to what extent.</p><h2>It’s not all about “full system efficiency”-some components need to be efficient- MIPS/joule for example- while others, such as energy harvesting, are relativistic. An internal combustion engine is 34% efficient. A generator/turbine, likewise may be as well. A solar panel, on the other hand, may be 15%, but energy independence is priceless. Let consumers decide.</h2><p>I think what people seem to forget is, that before homes were equipped the 1900s with electricity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Commercialization">incandescent</a>, the only people who could read past dusk were those who had a large stockpile of candles. I remember reading this article from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/science/earth/25fossil.html">2010</a>, just over 12 years ago, where small solar panels +LEDs and a small battery, essentially extended the reading time of villagers far from the city or utility grids.  There is still a large part of the world, 100 years later, that is living in an almost pre-Victorian time. And many more who may have acquired a cell phone at some point, but are unable to charge it or use it frequently, because they do not live near reliable power. This is because with all the technology and foundries available to chip designers, none of them are developing a product that accomplish basic communications while making use of the other side of Moore’s Law- the lower power to accomplish those tasks, so low, that it does not require the same size battery. </p><h3>"And, one of the things I've always found is that you've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology.

lost labor of walking miles every day. Designers in Silicon Valley aren’t thinking of Sara Ruto, but someone in a first world country. I refuse to believe that no one would buy such a phone. If chip designer included a solar panel on a phone, would it make a sound? That is, would anyone refuse it? I can imagine someone saying, “It’s got a solar panel?! Return it now! Wash your hands, it’ll turn us liberal! I only want one with a propane generator!” If you build it…</h6><p></p><p>And working your way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUASk0Z_mgE">backwards</a>, by building a Time Machine at the foundries.</p><h3>Energy Independence is Energy Security; Zero Trust Model</h3><p>In computer security, trust exists at multiple levels- some operating systems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability</a>-based use a key of instead of trust, but verify method, which may grant a higher privilege after a one time authorization. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model">zero trust</a>, the mode of access is “never trust, always verify”.</p><p>Applied to energy security, what this means is, a regional energy grid system may be relatively secure and not prone to attacks/vulnerable. However, the risk level may be above what may be tolerated by certain institutions or individuals (e.g. hospitals, emergency services), those with <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321651#cpap-and-bipap">BiPAP</a> machines. Therefore, those usually seek additional backup power solutions, such as generators (if afforded by the individual).</p><p>The concept of a solar powered phone or computer is rooted partly in the idea that an energy grid is any of the three: a) non-existent/unavailable b) unreliable/susceptible to damage and c) available and reliable, but a high/singular dependence on it creating a possible future risk/high load. Therefore, it adopts the zero-trust model of computer security, by not assuming the grid is available and reliable. It does not assume the energy is accessible- it may opt for a dual-charging system-USB and solar panels, at a higher premium of a bill of materials. It could also rely just on solar power to lower the cost of materials, or some other energy source. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png" width="795" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:795,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:152244,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bca9e97-35fd-43cf-94e0-e55279d2e72c_795x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In essence, solar powered phones and laptops use zero trust in their energy production systems because on-device power generation (whether a modular, plug and play PMIC and panel, or an integrated solar panel) brings energy access to the individual, and allows the individual to rely even less on infrastructure to communicate autonomously.

It is an important concept in effective altruism and serves as a primary motivation for efforts to reduce existential risks to humanity.[1]”</p><p> For one, it’s unclear what economic system proponents of long termism believe in, as it would reveal much about their approach to the long-term. Some academics have observed a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3995225">preferential </a>status for elite planners among Effective altruists, adhering to a “techno-utopian approach” to planning and <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/09/10/selling-longtermism-how-pr-and-marketing-drive-a-controversial-new-movement/">development</a>.  </p><p>“2.1.2 Defining Existential Risk under the TUA Bostrom provides two general formulations of existential risk. He initially defined it as “where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential”13 . Later, he provided a more refined definition: “one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development”</p><p>“By leaving “value” and “potential” undefined, these latter definitions theoretically avoid the charge of existential risk as being a project of a niche philosophical view”</p><p>“First, in practice, value is still expressed in techno-utopian terms. For example, the last chapter of The Precipice expands on a vision of humanity’s potential: transhumanist space expansion receives ample attention and adoration. Unrecoverable civilisational collapse (a state in which technological progress is not ensured) is described as an existential risk. Here, “civilisational collapse” refers to a permanent reversion back to non-agricultural ways of living. It is not explained why the presence of agriculture, or many of the commonly assumed trappings of “civilisation”, such as urbanism, writing, and states (although these rarely came as a coherent package, see Graeber and Wengrow52) would increase the likelihood of reaching our potential. For a techno-utopian, it does. For others who value virtue, freedom, or equality, it is unclear why a long-term future without industrialisation is abhorrent: it all depends on one’s notion of potential. The definition is seemingly agnostic in the abstract, but in practice there are numerous signals that it expresses the same commitment to total utilitarianism and transhumanism.</p><p>Secondly, we need to define what our potential is before we can identify threats to it. How else would we know which risks to address? This is an inherent tension within The Precipice since we are supposed to achieve existential security before undertaking the Long Reflection. It is difficult to know if we have achieved existential security if we haven’t defined what an existential risk is, since we haven’t undertaken the Long Reflection to define our potential. A reasonable counter could be that, in theory, there are certain futures that almost no one would like to live in (such as nuclear winter), and that there may be certain risks (for instance, an asteroid strike) that would take lots of plausibly good options off the table. Extinction may indeed be an outcome which we could assume most people would agree we should avoid. Beyond this point of convergence, there may be far more disagreement on what futures are worth protecting”</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. I’m promoting post-apocalyptic tech. But I’m not the one advocating for nuclear power. If you think about where your purchases go, they support chip manufacturers that apparently have no interest in designing energy efficient devices that are affordable, ones that can help people stay in contact with employers in a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/24/winter-storm-updates-deaths-crashes-power-outages/10950466002/">winter </a>storm where the power is out, and not give the impression that they quit or not on their way. This kind of tech has every day uses. The hard truth is that not many people can maintain a good charge on their phone and it’s not always their fault. I’ve survived a 5 day power outage in 4 feet of snow using a trusty 2004 era Nokia in 2006, turning it off most of the day. Thanks to Nokia. No thanks to Android, which fortunately did not exist at the time and would not have stood a chance. There is also <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Apocaloptimist">term</a>, that resists the typical narrative of declining living standards.

Well, e-waste is an existential risk. One may be for EA’s support of AI research, while cautioning against its applications. These involve the continued development of ever-increasing semi-conductors, which in turn can result in a competition for an edge in AGI. Remember Net-neutrality? And how there was all that discussion on fast lanes and slow internet lanes? Well, imagine <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/china-fabless-verisilicon-touts-shift-to-design-lite/">foundry neutrality</a> issues, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_play#Pure_play_foundries">pure-play</a> foundries giving preferential treatment to AI and other ML research, while small-time developers and consumer products from fabless startups can’t get enough fundraising to get a seat at the leading edge node. AGI may not benefit individuals immediately as quickly as it can benefit organizations. Though as mentioned in a previous post- time sharing of open source AI is likely and already available. <strong>Edit 3/8/2023: </strong>My predictions have been echoed!: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/just-when-we-thought-we-were-safe-chatgpt-is-coming-for-our-graphics-cards">https://www.techradar.com/news/just-when-we-thought-we-were-safe-chatgpt-is-coming-for-our-graphics-cards</a> After a quick query, I only found 2 Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22foundry+neutrality%22">search results</a> that mention “foundry neutrality” other than my own:  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png" width="742" height="1376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1376,&quot;width&quot;:742,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:286294,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216dbed9-a7ad-43a6-9388-3fe927050030_742x1376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Not bad for a homebew wordsmith coinage foundry! ;)</p><p>Another example, consider George Orwell’s 1984, or Terry Gilliam’s <em>Brazil</em>.

To do this, drones (since humans can’t be trusted) install them in every corridor and room of every building.

Therefore, the regulatory agency, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">captured</a> by the lobbyists, already understand that this technology can be used to efficiently run on low enough power to never need batteries, and the wealthiest multinationals fulfill the largest orders of the chips for AI and surveillance, enabling a head start on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">digital </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a> government as well as ensuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance">sousveillance</a> is impossible through centralized smart grid control, limiting the charging or use of electronic devices during only state sanctioned activities/work.

It is a very clear cost — the thermal impact, and carbon footprint. There’s a strong motivation. But if you look at something like an embedded system, especially with edge-based intelligence, there is a very different cost in terms of battery life. This trickle-down of technology, tools, and methodology means they are able to leverage those exact same things that the hyperscale customers are using, but they’re doing it in a much smaller footprint and much more fine-grain method and achieving their own benefits.” from this <a href="https://semiengineering.com/challenges-with-adaptive-control/">article</a>.</p><p>Thus, hyperscalers want to leverage a foundries’ tech, using power as a design feature, but a designer might want to reserve all the tooling to create multicore chips- over 64 cores (which admittedly would be more power efficient than an earlier transistor). But if the foundry only has so much tooling to design wafers for a single customer using a very special instrument, then there could be potential scarcity and competition for a FinFET lithography technique for NTV, which could be repurposed for manufacturing single core chips- which could serve many customers instead of one data center.</p><p>Another way of thinking of a hyperscaler is a hedgefund.

This is a preferred route that is not unreasonable and has been achieved before in the Silicon Industry.</p><p><strong>This is a POWER PI candidate, but why was the Raspberry Pi successful?</strong></p><p>As a dedicated Set-Top Box / IPTV solution, the initial Pi processor, the 700 mhz ARM11 BCM2835, was only available from Broadcomm in Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ) of 5 million and above. As a specialist Vertical Market Applications Processor, it was <em>not available</em> for use in products on the general market.</p><p>The <em>only reason</em> that it went into the Raspberry Pi at all (selling in far smaller quantities) was because Eben Upton was an employee of Broadcom and had access to NDA'd internal datasheets. Crucially: on learning that it was to be deployed in an Educational market, Broadcom could not exactly say "no."</p><p>In eight years, 36 million "Pi" units have been sold. However this is not all the same processor: there are four variants (Model A/B thru Pi 4). Thus actual quantities sold through the Pi Foundation of any one given processor average only around a million units, each processor. As above: 1 million sales barely covers the NREs.</p><p>In the intervening years, despite persistent requests on Pi Forums, even efforts by the Raspberry Pi Foundation themselves to see a non-Broadcom processor be developed and deployed have not been successful because a Pi-only-centric processor <em>does not have a large enough market share to justify the NREs</em>.</p><p><strong>The lesson here is that a low-cost processor must cover multiple markets to be successful</strong>.</p><p>Consequently the Libre-SOC "POWER Pi" is designed to enter multiple disparate large-volume markets: the Educational and Open aspects may thus be considered an essential part of the P.R. rather than as major sales opportunities.” </p><p> Assuming a NTV application processor could even be produced, a chip designer wouldn’t justify the cost unless at least 5 million could be produced, AND it could be justified for some philanthropic purpose- for <a

1</a>”, that someone in a first world country could purchase two, each for $200 ($400), and donate the other to someone in need.</p><p>Imagine the same with a solar powered phone- Considering a lower bill of materials, a dumbphone might cost $100 each, and to make the purchase profitable to the chip designer  foundry, they’d need 1st world countries to buy 2 or three to help reach the MOQ, and to recoup the investment.</p><h3>The Chip Industry is Decadent and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/05/04/180907071/a-decadent-and-depraved-derby-with-hunter-s-thompson">Depraved</a></h3><div

completely wasteful way of planning for the future. While it is true that the cost of natural and solid woods has increased in price and scarcity, the cheaper particleboard and plastic substitutes for furniture should not be an excuse to wish a short life-cycle. The preservation of manufactured goods should last as long as its functional ability withstands. In lieu of merely repeating ideas about how social reform could be implemented, I would promote the use of a basic universal phone, similar to a guaranteed minimum income (or universal basic income, UBI). The difference, is that  even though a guaranteed minimum income will not be able to cover even a majority of one’s rent, that money would undoubtedly be used one day to purchase a new phone. The phone itself may not have software updates after 3-4 years, placing it at risk of vulnerabilities. However, by reducing the attack surface in designing a feature phone, a phone could <a href="http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html">last </a>30-40 years, if not <a href="https://ploum.net/the-computer-built-to-last-50-years/">50</a>. This could also encourage users to maintain their devices for much longer, rewarding users for their preservation, rather than rewarding conspicuous disposal culture (the last stage of the cycle of conspicuous consumption).</p><div id="youtube2-h0sxwGlTLWw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;h0sxwGlTLWw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h0sxwGlTLWw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h6>Italian American actors such as Espera Oscar de Corti (1904-1999) care just as much about the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-indian-crying-environment-ads-pollution-1123-20171113-story.html">environment </a>as natives. My ancestors were living in Italy at the time of this video, thus were not responsible for disposal of litter.</h6><p>There should a separation between the basic necessity of a phone, and a mobile device that today is primarily used to run apps. Yes, it is not always the case that someone may need to send a text to anyone locally or to use the call function. Apps are just as important as SMS &amp; calls. However, in a bread and butter kind of way, texts and calls are important at the<em> local level. </em>For being able to communicate nearby is integral to a resilient network that can load share and develop overengineered redundancy with decentralized systems<em> </em>The disruptive innovation of IRC &amp; VOIP certainly reduced the cost of a long distance call to the cost of maintaining the infrastructure, because it can now be done with off-the shelf components, if one really needed to.  Thus just as important as a UBI, and universal and affordable housing, is a universal basic phone. But just as important as the software is the hardware, and prioritizing energy independence at the portable level could be a more effective way at assisting users who possess such a phone from no longer needing to crowd a Starbucks or a library to charge their phone. They can do it wherever they are, provided there is sunlight. A user could treat a phone like a credit card, storing it in their wallet due to how thin it could be made (Just don’t sit on your wallet or pack it with too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g">free</a> guitar lesson coupons). Developing a long-lasting phone isn’t so much longtermism and building a resilient network, so much as it is building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">anti-fragile</a> one.</p><p><strong>“Ubiquitous computing</strong> (or "<strong>ubicomp</strong>") is a concept in software engineering, hardware engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format. “The underlying technologies to support ubiquitous computing include Internet, advanced middleware, operating system, mobile code, sensors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">microprocessors</a>, new I/O and user interfaces, computer networks, mobile protocols, location and positioning, and new materials.</p><p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm">paradigm</a> is also described as <strong>pervasive computing</strong>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing#cite_note-Nieuwdorp2007-Discourse-1">[1]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_intelligence">ambient intelligence</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing#cite_note-2">[2]</a> or "everyware".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing#cite_note-3">[3]</a> Each term emphasizes slightly different aspects. When primarily concerning the objects involved, it is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing">physical computing</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a>, haptic computing,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing#cite_note-4">[4]</a> and "things that think".</p><p>Before I delve into ubiquitous computing, I should emphasize that userspace apps like phone calls and texts are just one instance of the potential of the emergence of ubiquitous computing. The solar autarkic capabilities of ultra-low power microcontrollers represents one of the first commercially available instances of enough processing power to run human user interfaces without a battery. Microcontrollers with less than a Cortex M3 are unlikely to have much capability for an HMI (Human machine interface) outside of sensor networks and PLCs, Hardware designers such as EmCraft, who previously built uClinux on Cortex M4s, have also confirmed this. Thus the Ambiq Micro Apollo4’s Cortex M4, and other FOSS SoC designs using <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/06/18/notkia-building-an-open-and-linux-powered-numpad-phone/">MIPS</a>, and low power RISC-V represents a way for developers to design circuits for individuals, and not just machines to compute ubiquitously. Meeting all energy autarkic requirements of ubiquitous computing first requires designing just the minimum amount of architecture and software to run singular apps (or a series of apps), so that computing requires far less stationary charging (USB/AC outlet) or connectivity (Ethernet/Wifi)- as opposed to long-range wireless- 4G/LoRA, etc than fully featured multi-core chips used to run very large modern kernels. </p><h4>A New Era of Solar Convergence &amp; Multimedia-Deconvergence</h4><p>The development of advanced multimedia and memory intensive software (apps that require more than 4MB of RAM), should be placed on a lower/non-priority in the initial development towards an autarkic userspace kernel, such as Symbian’s EKA2. The development of EKA2 consolidated signal stacks (telephony) and Personal Information Management PIM stacks using a single processor core (Sales, 2005), forming a pillar of energy efficient design. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png" width="1280" height="271" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:271,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:175174,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d60aa44-9850-47df-bcb3-fa524c542937_1280x271.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The UniSOC T117 appears to  be one of the only commercially available phone chips (used in the Nokia 225 4G) in 2022 that eschews the multi processor SoC found in favor of a single core processor core which appears to use a single RTOS, which suggests it follows in the tradition of the Symbian OS era, if not being a spiritual successor (although not in a very transparent SDK). Of course these processors all use anywhere from 16-64MB of RAM, which is far more than what an Ambiq Apollo4 uses. Thus one approach would be to recreate the early EKA1-era Nokia 7650, being the first Symbian OS 6.1 S60 phone from 2001 which used just 4MB of RAM.

And of course, who's afraid of Virginia Woolf means who's afraid of the big <em>bad</em> wolf . . . who's afraid of living life without false illusions.

When does bespoke also become something you can buy on the commercial market? Cisco recently came out with their networking chip. They finally built their own networking chip, but they’re also selling it on the market. So how bespoke is bespoke? If you can buy it, it’s a standard product.”</p><p>by standard, it is referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit#Application-specific_standard_product">ASSP</a>. But also:</p><p>“If you can afford to make your own silicon and make it run faster than anything else out there, you’ve got to wonder at some point <strong>how much of a general market is going to be left</strong> for others,” Swinnen said.</p><p>Now, I will speculate but not accuse anyone, that what this sounds like is an  opportunity of startups and established, resourced companies to engage in product fixing. This is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing">price fixing</a> (for established products), but before products are even made. Now, price fixing (another related term is “gentleman’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen's_agreement">agreement</a>”) might actually be interpreted as healthy, since it promotes the existence of more than one vendor, <em>except</em>….in cases where the minimum performance of both products TDP are far more power consuming than one that is designed to use as little as power as possible. But the fact that there is even a concern about how much a market would be left reveals that a limited number of players seem to still wield control over the pace of innovation, as opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_saturation">saturated</a> 3rd party hardware market, where awareness of a product has not only passed the niche phase, but has led to significant numbers of rivals to make control over design much less vertically integrated. For example, if there was never an IBM-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible">compatible </a>standard, there might not be a Gigabyte, Biostar, Asus company manufacturing ATX motherboards. If, for example, Apple became a computer monopoly like AT&amp;T and was the sole supplier of computer hardware, users wouldn’t be able to mix and match 3rd party hardware (e.g. a video card from MSI, a monitor from Asus), because Apple’s hardware wouldn’t support it- it would be a walled hardware garden. See “Plato’s ideal” above. Thus a “freer” market would be one where there are many more designers that target general purpose <em>and </em>the lowest thermal power design- that could represent the Plato’s ideal and the physical limit (“Everybody to the limit”) of computation per watt. </p><p>Having studied some action potentials in biology, coursework in college, I very familiar with the natural ion channels that comprise cellular membranes and dendrites. I do think this certainly could lead to more power efficient computing, using biomimetic, (and hopefully not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering#Ethical_considerations">sentient </a>computing), but general purpose non-von Neumann computing appears to be quite far off. One paper says it is Turing Complete, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13983">though</a>. I think technology is trying to accomplish far too much with biomimicry of the brain before computers can be given to each human, which can serve as an offline encyclopedia, something I had in <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/encarta/1995">1996</a>, before I even had access to the internet. It seems a lot fairer for all humans to have access (you could say, an inalienable right) to information before computers are built using synapses for the few. </p><div id="youtube2-ykxMqtuM6Ko" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ykxMqtuM6Ko&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ykxMqtuM6Ko?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>“I predict that within 100 years, computers will be twice as powerful and a thousand times larger and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will own them.”</p><p>““We are all now talking about systems of systems,” said Gupta. “As we look to these companies, we’re seeing they have a system of systems mindset.

It is a very clear cost — the thermal impact, and carbon footprint. There’s a strong motivation. But if you look at something like an embedded system, especially with edge-based intelligence, there is a very different cost in terms of battery life. This trickle-down of technology, tools, and methodology means they are able to leverage those exact same things that the hyperscale customers are using, but they’re doing it in a much smaller footprint and much more fine-grain method and achieving their own benefits.” </p><p>What I’m reading from that above paragraph, is that this is the chance of a generation of  environmental computer engineers to organize and develop new “system of systems”, ones that integrate new energy sources, such as solar, low power displays, antennas, and an <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177716-the-libre-autarkic-laptop">all-star team</a> of low power PCB components instead of iterations of hyperscaling, which are more or less saving money for an establishment of datacenters and expensive chips, rather than lowering the barriers to entry and allowing this technology to trickle down into single or low-core chips consumer devices by those who ordinarily would need to charge their phones/laptops.</p><p>What’s that you say?

While it did everything the U required and then some, to the committee it felt like a middle finger. “You’re not supposed to have written this!” Alberti says of the group’s reaction. “This is some lark, never do this again!” The Gopher team was forbidden from further work on the protocol.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif" width="320" height="128" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:80,&quot;width&quot;:200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;folder and computer icons&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="folder and computer icons" title="folder and computer icons" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d2e2233-f062-4c6b-83c8-326c618cf925_200x80.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Oh, I see, you didn’t want that technology to end up in layman’s devices.

A good institution would teach you quite the opposite-consider <em>all </em>signals, however weak. The lack of detecting a signal depends on the sensitivity of the instrument, rather than the stimuli/particle. The above Lara Bingle “The Project” interview covers that- if you watch the whole interview. Some things can’t be quantized. It requires intuitive instinct, and in some cases, a really good nose. There also isn’t a huge job market for psychics and mystics; the elimination of the Romanov family in 1917 eliminated the position of Rasputin. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQJ0EmSe-ik?t=20">Jim Joe Kelly</a>’s funding ran out quite quickly, at $500k/week, and Tyrion Lannister’s wits involve likely involve compromising his soul, with lust for <a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister">power</a>: “"<em>If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now.</em>"</p><p>Rather, I look to Shakespeare’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_fool">Fool </a>as an inspiration, who were commoners with no particular thirst for power, just enough to subsist and to serve as a barometer for nobility surrounded by yes-men and and echo chambers of mass discontent. </p><p>“The "groundlings" (theatre-goers who were too poor to pay for seats and thus stood on the 'ground' in the front by the stage) that frequented the Globe Theatre were more likely to be drawn to these Shakespearean fools. However they were also favoured by the nobility. Most notably, Queen Elizabeth I was a great admirer of the popular actor who portrayed fools, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Tarlton">Richard Tarlton</a>. For Shakespeare himself, however, actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Armin">Robert Armin</a> may have proved vital to the cultivation of the fool character in his many plays.”</p><p>Perhaps King Lear has one of the most prominent appearances of the Fool:</p><p>“Writes Jan Kott, in <em>Shakespeare Our Contemporary</em>,</p><blockquote><p>The Fool does not follow any ideology. He rejects all appearances, of law, justice, moral order. He sees brute force, cruelty and lust. He has no illusions and does not seek consolation in the existence of natural or supernatural order, which provides for the punishment of evil and the reward of good. Lear, insisting on his fictitious majesty, seems ridiculous to him. All the more ridiculous because he does not see how ridiculous he is. But the Fool does not desert his ridiculous, degraded king, and accompanies him on his way to madness. The Fool knows that the only true madness is to recognize this world as rational.”</p></blockquote><p>Another thing I noticed about Brand’s videos are, his appearances are entirely improvised. It takes wit to invent clever quips; which makes me wonder- how frequent others choose to live a life according to notecard-prepared dialogue. </p><p>Ethnographers observe from the outside, and can dissociate themselves from almost any culture or society, to academia’s benefit (and sometimes, to the detriment of the subject).  </p><p>Comedians also speak from the outside- at least some understand this: “Rivers accepted such criticism as the price of using social satire as a form of humor: "I've learned to have absolutely no regrets about any jokes I've ever done&nbsp;... You can tune me out, you can click me off, it's OK. I am not going to bow to political correctness. But you do have to learn, if you want to be a satirist, you can't be part of the party."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers#cite_note-111">[111]</a>”</p><p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Kunzru">Hari Kunzru</a> wrote, "The true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist&nbsp;... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#cite_note-4">[4]</a>”</p><p>Is having this capability a good thing?

The study of <a href="https://myprimals.com/">primal </a>worldviews is a sincere effort to bridge understanding of what divides great nations. The repeal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine">fairness doctrine</a> in 1987 appears to have resulted in a decline in critical news journalism, as well as viewership preferences. One of the things that makes the world great is the existence of foreign languages. The person who views the glass half-empty, may take the flawed view that the inability to understand a foreign language necessarily suggests some kind of enmity. As Leo Tolstoy wrote, the Kingdom of God is within you. I recall watching a PBS video of manual farming in 1980s in China, saying they do not use tractors because the purpose of life is not to be idle (understandably, a low tech way to keep 1 billion employed). A single language would certainly cause idleness in the world, and one might get the impression that one’s entire vocation in life is to climb up the Tower of Babel, like Humpty Dumpty. </p><p>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,<br>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br>All the king's horses and all the king's men<br>Couldn't put Humpty together again.</p><p>Foreign languages certainly hold only the potential for translations, but not everything can be translated if one language has no equivalent in another. Some might try to climb back up the Tower of Babel, ignoring what can’t be translated, even with the help of foreigners, but reaching the top of the tower is not a metaphorical restoration of some kind of Garden of Eden. </p><div><hr></div><p>Earthbound for SNES was a rare example of eccentric mainstream success.

Not everything fits in a box; This has been known for decades. Why then, is society pre-occupied with commercializing things that fit in a box? The vast majority of AAA games today are appeal to the lowest common denominator (LCD)- Call of Duty, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto- it isn’t to say there are necessarily bad gamers much like there are <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/emily-nussbaum-tv-book-i-like-to-watch.html">bad fans</a>, but outliers serve society no less than things that fit in a box. I recall years back, watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row">Saints Row</a> developers talk about how their game was a reaction to the stale AAA designs. The fact that the game was revolting to some, suggests they succeeded at <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/saints-row-2022-why-do-so-many-gamers-hate-it">identifying </a>what makes mainstream products a LCD. (For the record, I don’t play Saint’s Row but can understand its appeal) This isn’t to say LCD mainstream products can’t be fun, they surely are, but that formulaic design that attempts to capture mass appeal will always fall short of some unrealistic market share, suggesting obvious limits to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/why-call-of-duty-game-matters-to-the-ftc-in-microsoft-activision-deal/">trying </a>to achieve a monopoly on creative IP and talent, which I assume some would concede is impossible. </p><p>And what happened to all that <a href="https://gabebullard.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-weird-tv#details">weird TV</a>?</p><p>"A few years after Stefan Urquelle’s swan song, Meyer summed up contemporary TV comedy as “a bunch of people who hang around in some generic urban setting having conversations and sniping at each other.”"</p><p>‘As the sitcom format matured, the subject matter narrowed.
