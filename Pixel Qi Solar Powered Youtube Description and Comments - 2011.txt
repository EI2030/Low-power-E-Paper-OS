A quite small modern solar panel can produce 1W of power, enough to power both the Pixel Qi and the whole ARM Powered tablet motherboard behind it. Think for a second how amazing this is. They can put solar panels on the bezel  and the Tablet could basically be fully solar powered, have a bigger solar panel on the back of the tablet if you want to just charge it and not use it. This compact 1W Solar panel is $3. OLPC could be using this for the upcoming OLPC XO-1.75 Laptop and the XO-3 tablet.

1W total power consumption is really impressive. I know a Freescale i.MX51-based system that uses ~3.5W (1.2GHz A8) (Efika MX Smartbook) not counting the screen. so getting this down to 1W is really an accomplishment.

You could use perhaphs translucent photovoltaics underneath the screen. Instead of competing with the sun like the LCD other lit displays do, one would harness the energy of the sun.

Can you give me one striking argument, why not all smartphones and tablets have this integrated ? I mean, battery is the problem no. 1 for these devices and that's just the perfect solution - green, endless battery life, for free.

Leaving the screen in the sun is a bad idea, ...putting it on the rear is an option - how many of us actually see what's on the screen in full sunlight - or even spend time reading in the sun for that matter.
