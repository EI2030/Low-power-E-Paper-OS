Linux Programming Tip: avoiding the use of ellipses allows a program to use far less memory.

"1. In Programming (C, C++, Python, R) 

In several programming languages used in Linux environments, an ellipsis (...) in a function signature signifies that the function accepts a variable number of arguments. 
Example (C/C++): The standard printf function is declared as int printf(const char* format, ...); where the ellipsis allows it to take many different arguments.
"No Ellipses" Function: A function without an ellipsis in its definition has a fixed number and type of parameters, which allows the compiler to perform strict type-checking and argument counting. "

I imagine these grammatical techniques were more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s, but became forgotten or obscure as time went on due to increasing memory capacities.

_"What the ESL crowd missed was the massive gain that comes from compounding little gains. I am still somewhat blinkered by going for the big win (that would probably make me a bad gambler), but content recently gathered for a couple of articles has provided examples of how those small gains are a better use of time and money than gambling on the next big thing._

_The first example is from Marc Swinnen at Ansys, who talked about power optimization. I had asked about the amount of power being wasted in a typical design. “In the past, I have talked to customers about this very problem. I might tell them that using my tool will save them 10%, 15% power. Their response might be, ‘That’s not going to make my day. That’s not worth it to me. Then there is another technique. What will that save me? I tell them that it will save you 5% or 7%. That’s not worth my time.’ Every technique was shot down because it wasn’t worth their time. And at the end they say, how is it that my competitor can manage to get these really low-power designs? Because they pay attention to power at every single step along the way, even the small increments, it all adds up. You can disregard the small contributions at every step, but in the end, it’s like going on a diet. Any particular cookie, any particular walk, isn’t going to make a big difference, but it all adds up over time. And that’s how you achieve a result — by being conscientious at every step.”_

_Many others agree this is the only way to achieve a low-power design, except some add that it only takes one bad cookie to spoil the whole thing. A very power-efficient piece of hardware cannot provide the expected savings if bad software is put on it, especially if it doesn’t use the very features that the hardware inserted to make it power efficient. Lots of small improvements can make a very big difference."_

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/intel-details-everything-that-could-go-wrong-with-us-taking-a-10-stake/

"But to critics of the deal, it seems weird for the US to swoop in and take stake in a company that doesn't need government assistance. The only recent precedent was the US temporarily taking stake in key companies considered vital to the economy that risked going under during the 2008 financial crisis.

Compare that to the Intel deal, where Tan has made it clear that Intel, while struggling to compete with rivals, *"didn't need the money,"* Reuters noted—largely due to SoftBank purchasing $2 billion in Intel shares in the days prior to the US agreement being reached. Instead, the US is incentivized to take the stake to help further Trump's mission to quickly build up a domestic chip manufacturing supply chain that can keep the US a global technology leader at the forefront of AI innovation.

Investors told Reuters that it's unusual for the US to take this much control over a company that's not in crisis, noting that "this level of tractability was not usually associated with relations between businesses and Washington."

In the 2009 PBS Documentary _Breaking the Bank,_ The Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson summoned the top 7 Bank's CEOs to Washington on Sunday, October 12th, 2008 before the markets opened Monday morning, after Lehman's Brother's went into bankruptcy the week before:

https://youtu.be/sYmGNetu-UU?t=1622 

25:21
>> NARRATOR: Three days after Lehman's bankruptcy, Paulson headed to congress.
>> 
25:28
>> 
>> He had decided to dramatically change his approach.
>> 
25:34
>> At that point, Paulson bowed to the inevitable. One thing Paulson said to me in an interview is,
>> 
25:40
>> "When the situation changes, you have to be willing to change with the situation."
>> 
25:47
>> NARRATOR: Fed chairman Ben Bernanke joined Paulson for the emergency meeting.
>> 
25:52
>> On Thursday, late afternoon, they go to Nancy Pelosi's office.
>> 
25:58
>> And there's a meeting of the senior legislators from both parties in both House and Senate.
>> 
26:06
>> It was obviously a big meeting. I had no idea I was goingto hear what I heard.

26:11
>> NARRATOR: Paulson now believed government intervention was necessary, and he'd need hundreds of billions
>> 
26:17
>> from Congress to do it. >> They said they needed the authority to use $700 billion
>> 
26:22
>> to unstop the credit markets. >> Sitting in that room with Hank Paulson saying to us--
>> 
26:29
>> in a very measured tones, no hyperbole, no excessive adjectives--that unless you act,
>> 
26:35
>> the financial system of this country and the world will melt down in a matter of days.
>> 
26:41
>> Bernanke said,"If we don't do this tomorrow, we won't have an economy on Monday."
>> 
26:49
>> There was literally a pause in that room where the oxygen left. >> NARRATOR: Paulson received the money,
>> 
26:56
>> $700 billion known as TARP, troubled asset relief program.
>> 
27:02
>> On October 12, he acted. >> I got a phone call on Sunday from Secretary Paulson,
>> 
27:07
>> and he basically said, "Ken, I need you to be in Washington Monday." And he said, "I really can't tell you a lot about it."
>> 
27:15
>> NARRATOR: With the Merrill merger not yet complete, Paulson also invited John Thain. >> He said, "Be at the Treasury at 3:00 tomorrow."
>> 
27:23
>> I... I said, "Well, what's the topic?" You'll find outwhen you get there." I said, "Well, who's coming?"
>> 
27:30
>> "You'll find out when you get there. See you at 3:00." Click.
>> 
27:35
>> NARRATOR: Seven other heads of the nation's largest banks received a similar summons.
>> 
27:42
>> They turn up at 3:00, and they all file into the conference room,
>> 
27:48
>> which is across the hall from Mr. Paulson's office. >> NARRATOR: They were told to sit on one side of the table.
>> 
27:57
>> The titans of the finance world are arrayed almost like school children,
>> 
28:02
>> waiting to hear from the Treasury Secretary about a subject they're probably by then
>> 
28:07
>> slowly beginning to figure out. >> NARRATOR: John Thain's seat was in the middle.
>> 
28:13
>> Lewis was put at the end. >> At first, I wondered why I was down toward the end.
>> 
28:19
>> And... and then...and then it hit me, obviously, that it was in alphabetical order.
>> 
28:25
>> And how else would you do it? >> NARRATOR: Paulson got right down to business.
>> 
28:32
>> Because it's Paulson, who's not a man who beats around the bush, it became clear relatively quickly what he was proposing.
>> 
28:41
>> He says, "I've got here documents that say the U.S. government is going to make an injection
>> 
28:46
>> of capital into each oneof your companies." >> NARRATOR: Paulson was aboutto spend $125 billion
>> 
28:53
>> of that TARP money from Congress. >> They go through in a very, very rapid way that each of us
>> 
29:03
>> is going to take this taxpayer money, the TARP money.
>> 
29:10
>> And he basically says, you can't leave this room until you agree to take this money.
>> 
29:16
>> We're all going to do it for the good of the country, for the good of the system. And it's not really discretionary.
>> 
29:24
>> NARRATOR: It was unprecedented. In return for billions of dollars, the government would take an ownership stake in the banks.
>> 
29:32
>> Some bankers fought back. >> That was a very contentious meeting, lots of questions,
>> 
29:40

 lots of doubts. >> NARRATOR: Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo, led the charge.
>> 
29:48
>> 
 Kovacevich stood up and said, "I don't want the money. *"I don't need the money.* "I don't want the money. I want to have nothing to do with this."
>> 
29:56
>> NARRATOR: But Ken Lewis tooka different view. >> Ken Lewis says, "It's our patriotic duty to do this.
>> 
30:01
>> Let's stop fighting, do this deal right this moment." >> We are so intertwined with the U.S.
>> 
30:08
>> that it's hard to separate what's good for the United States and what's good for Bank of America.
>> 
30:13
>> And so, don't do it on the basis of being... us being told, do it on the basis that things could get a lot worse
>> 
30:19
>> in America, and therefore, for us. And they're almost one in the same.
>> 
30:25
>> NARRATOR: Lewis also knew that he could expect two TARP shares, Merrill Lynch's and his own.
>> 
30:32
>> He also said, "Look, guys, we all know how this is going to end. We're going to sign this piece of paper."
>> 
30:38
>> So he played a little bit of the elder statesmen role, explaining reality,
>> 
30:45
>> although they all understood reality quite well. >> NARRATOR: And if any bank didn't sign on,
>> 
30:50
>> Paulson had a potent weapon. >> There's a threat in the background.
>> 
30:56
>> If you don't get with the program and if you don't sign this piece of paper, tomorrow morning you could turn on the television
>> 
31:01
>> and see Hank Paulson talking about your bank in a negative way, and that's going to destroy you.
>> 
31:08
>> NARRATOR: Paulson's notes, prepared for the meeting, show he gave the bankers no choice.
>> 
31:14
>> If a capital infusion is not appealing, you should be aware that your regulator will require it in any circumstance.
>> 
31:22
>> NARRATOR: Paulson gave each man a single piece of paper spelling out the conditions.
>> 
31:28
>> Before they had to leave town that night, they were told, "Return this document with your signature on it."
>> 
31:33
>> And all nine of them did so.
>> 
31:41
>> NARRATOR: The next day, Paulson told the country about his new wayof doing business. >> Today we are taking decisive actions
>> 
31:50
>> to protect the U.S. economy. >> NARRATOR: In one day, everything had changed.
>> 
31:58
>> ...that the Treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts.
>> 
32:05
>> I think we nationalized the banks in the U.S. on that day. Seriously. Substantially nationalized them.
>> 
32:12
>> The government got a lot of sayin how they're run, a lot of constraints, a lot of responsibilities,

32:18
>> a lot of downside risk was taken on that day. >> Government owning a stake in any private U.S. company..."

This webpage is similar to fantasy football for semiconductor future products:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)
"Some of the more common derivatives include forwards, futures, options, swaps, and variations of these such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. Most derivatives are traded over-the-counter (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while most insurance contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the United States, after the 2008 financial crisis, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract#Origin 
Origin
The Dōjima Rice Exchange, first established in 1697 in Osaka, is considered by some to be the first futures exchange market, to meet the needs of samurai who—being paid in rice—needed a stable conversion to coin after a series of bad harvests.[6]

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) listed the first-ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts in 1864, which were called futures contracts. This contract was based on grain trading, and started a trend that saw contracts created on a number of different standardized futures contracts based on commodities, as well as a number of futures exchanges set up in countries around the world. By 1875 cotton futures were being traded in Bombay in India and within a few years this had expanded to futures on edible oilseeds complex, raw jute and jute goods and bullion.[7] In the 1930s two thirds of all futures was in wheat.[8]

The 1972 creation of the International Monetary Market (IMM) by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was the world's first financial futures exchange, and launched currency futures. In 1976, the IMM added interest rate futures on US treasury bills, and in 1982 they added stock market index futures.[9]

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/wallstreetbets except where instead of trading money over speculative stocks, the trading of information, similar to wall street bets can still be influential if the platform is influential. 

I am thinking of developing an app, called Fantasy Foundry. But I learned that it is a website for Tabletop RPGS: https://www.fantasyfoundry.store/ so I could be infringing on a trademark- (it rhymes like fantasy football, and can imply there is a free option, which would be ideally the goal of the app- to allow people to vote on a future chip idea or product- whether it is a memory chip or a logic chip. Update: I let CoPilot outline the app: https://github.com/copilot/c/30e01fb0-32e8-4d3e-87c7-ad3aae176146 https://github.com/hatonthecat/FantasyFoundry/blob/main/README.md 

Maybe Fantasy Semiconductor.  There is a twitter account https://x.com/Semiconductor24 <img width="487" height="77" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b133dff-0b74-4773-9f5e-ce777efca58b" /> Though they appear to include real stories..

So, the idea of fantasy would suggests virtual and possible, but not necessarily group contract, unless one wants it to be. Could be a useful way of gauging interest in a product, like a pre-[Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/) funding.   https://sheridancollege.libguides.com/groupwork/managing-group-projects/writing-a-group-contract#:~:text=Project%20Timeline%20%5BRTF%5D-,How%20to%20Create%20a%20Project%20Timeline,Examples%20include:

Crowdfunding the leading edge. A history in crowdfunding: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing#Historical_examples)

Timeline of crowdsourcing examples
"618–907 CE – The Tang dynasty of China introduced the joint-stock company, the earliest form of crowdfunding. This was evident during the cold period of the Tang Dynasty when the colder climates resulted in poor harvests and the lessening of agricultural taxes, culminating in the fragmentation of the agricultural sector.[20] The fragmentation meant that the government had to reform the tax system relying more on the taxation of salt and most importantly business leading to the creation of the Joint-Stock Company.[20]"

"In popular culture
In the movie The Big Short, which is based on Michael Lewis' book by the same name, an ISDA Master Agreement is referred to as a "hunting license", reserved only for the "big boys" (i.e. institutional investors). Originally devised with the banks and other institutional players in mind, the doors were opened to ultra-high net worth individuals. The maximum licenses at any point peaked at 3000.[3]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDA_Master_Agreement#In_popular_culture

<img width="1200" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/007c2536-fb5a-4f10-b6c8-59de8fed71b8" />

** 

https://en.softonic.com/articles/what-costs-more-to-manufacture-the-apple-a17-pro-or-the-snapdragon-8-gen-2

"In previous estimates, Nikkei media stated that manufacturing the A16 Bionic cost Apple $110, and the A17 Pro had a slightly higher price tag, at $130 each." 

** "It’s noteworthy that, despite being manufactured using TSMC’s 3nm process and facing performance issues, Apple managed to produce these chips for only $20 more for the latest version. It’s possible that the tech giant was able to reduce this cost by _increasing shipping volumes._" (emphasis added)


<img width="1200" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8cc105e-b4c7-403f-aab7-f34b7759f7a5" />


Want to buy the most energy efficiency DRAM in the world without unilaterally spending [$725 million](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/README.md#chart)? Groupon the change you want to see in the world. (I'm sure Ghandi would overlook the commercialization of his [quote](https://jenniferlphillips.com/blog/2021/2/24/origin-story-be-the-change), considering Apple appropriated him in the [1997 Ad campaign](http://youtube.com/watch?v=9-ZB2O8azI8&pp=0gcJCRsBo7VqN5tD) using public domain stock footage (He also got to license John Lennon's music because, well, he was neighbors with Yoko Ono at the Dakota). Now they are no longer the underdog, but as big as any multinational tech company organization can get.

"Be the change you wish to see in the world” is often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, which isn’t the whole story. This might be because Gandhi authored a passage that evokes the sentiment in a 1913 journal article for Indian Opinion:

We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do."

In order to outbid Apple, one needs to find enough buyers (like Groupon) to fullfill a minimum order quantity that is worth TSMC's time (or Global Foundries, or Samsung).

The Big Short ISDA master agreement became democratized with later apps such as Robinhood, where access to high-frequency trading and speculative markets became accessible to smaller investors (which still carry risk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_Markets )

So what does this have to do with designing chips? Well, instead of investing in company stock like Intel or Nvidia at the NYSE, investors can do more research and determine what kind of technology they'd like to see. Instead of being happy with more iPhones and AI chips, developers can agree on where research and development should be directed. By pledging to invest in a fund (binding or non), you can crowdfund a specific type of chip that has more general purpose use, instead of something that is less general purpose (or vertically integrated into a custom design, such as the Apple A17) 

https://semiengineering.com/baby-steps-towards-3d-dram/

"First step is a smaller cell
It’s far easier to optimize a single layer of DRAM cells than it is to stack them up, although “easier” is a relative term. The simplest way is to print smaller features. This can be done either by pushing self-aligned double and quadruple patterning (SADP, SAQP) using 193nm ArF lithography or moving to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography.

“Most recent steps toward footprint reduction pit EUV patterning against traditional ArF SADP and SAQP processes for cutting-edge 2D DRAM nodes,” said Daniel Soden, business development manager at Brewer Science."

[187] 2023 Apple 3 nm 103.8 mm^2 183,044,315
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count

"Assuming 156,000,000 transistors would be remaining for DRAM, or a combination
of large caches and extra power saving modes, a 1mm^2 die
would be expected to support up to 16MB of DRAM using
1T/1C (16MB is equal to 134 million bits)[22]. As 64MB is
536,870,912 bits, a 3nm node would require 4mm^2 die
space using A17’s process node technology (a max of 732
million transistors, using 183m x 4 as an estimate in 2mm x
2mm squares)."  https://www.techrxiv.org/users/814616/articles/1270555-a-heuristic-method-for-designing-solar-circuits

Apple was able to reserve the 3nm TSMC foundry at $130 per 103mm^2 for their A17 chip since they ordered in a significant volume. That same wafer space could be used to manufacture 100 1mm^2 $2 32MB DRAM with 10mW power consumption, low enough to solar power a netbook, along with chips which could be used for IoT, routers, IP cameras, smartwatches, fitbits, automotive, with a large enough consortium of interested buyers. Kind of like a publicly traded company, crowdsourcing the leading edge could outbid Apple and benefit more than just the top tech companies. 

If companies could agree on a common RAM size to order for their PCBs (e.g. 16MB, 32MB, 64MB), they could have a leading edge memory chip only available to the wealthiest tech companies (FAANG). AMD's EPYC Genoa already produces 96MB of L3 cache at 5nm. A smaller amount could be used for microcontrollers, drones, laptops, cell phones, with excellent battery life, and not dependent on ginormous Android operating systems.  

Actually, nevermind any of this. If it makes too much sense, it's not making enough money for someone else. For others, I don't know what I'm talking about. Really....I'm no expert, but experts continue to talk Business to Business, when the economic model changed 40 years ago with the Macintosh. This is the era of drop-shipping, Direct to Consumer (D2C). It's only a matter of time before normies start wishing what the leading edge should manufacture. Maybe I'm the first, but I am probably not the last. 

If this wish sounds impractical, just look at the competition:

From an 8-26 Stratchery post: https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/
"Steelmanning
I’ll be honest: there is a very good chance this won’t work. Intel really is a mess: they are actively hostile to customers, no one in the industry trusts them, they prioritize the wrong things even today (i.e. technical innovation with backside power over yields for chips which don’t necessarily have interference issues), and that’s even without getting into the many problems with their business. Moreover, I led with Lincicome’s argument because I agree! Government involvement in private business almost always ends badly."

Blind faith eventually wears off, not because some people miraculously get cured of blindness, but because a blind person over time listens more carefully, and can hear a huckster in an inflatable carrier ship.

https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/intel/359868-making-intel-great-again/ maybe it matters less who in the U.S. owns the Intel Foundry and more about what they're manufacturing.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/billionaire-big-tech-frugal-elon-musk-innovation

"There’s a common misconception that state-of-the-art technology has to be expensive, energy consumptive and hard to engineer. That’s because we have been persuaded to believe that innovative technology is whatever bombastic billionaires claim it is, whether that’s commercial spacecraft or the endless iterations of generative AI tools.

As the Canadian technologist and engineer Ursula Franklin once said, fantasies of technology would have it that innovation is always “investment-driven, shiny, lab-born, experimental, exciting”. But more often than not, in the real world, it is “needs-driven, scrappy, on location, iterative, practical, mundane”. The real pioneering technologies of today are genuinely useful systems I like to call “frugal tech”, and they are brought to life not by eccentric billionaires but by people doing more with less. They don’t impose top-down “solutions” that seem to complicate our lives while making a few people very rich. It turns out that genuinely innovative technology really can set people free."

How Much Does a 2nm Chip Really Cost? - 725M per chip! 

We often talk about Moore’s Law…But rarely about its cost.
This chart reveals what it actually takes — in dollars — to design a modern chip at bleeding-edge nodes:

→ 28nm: $48M

 → 22nm: $63M
 
 → 16nm: $90M
 
 → 7nm: $249M
 
 → 5nm: $449M
 
 → 3nm: $581M
 
 → 2nm: $725M

And it’s not just tape-out or EDA tools.
Each nanometer drop demands more effort across the entire stack:

 Architecture:
Defining compute units, memory hierarchy, interconnect — the strategic brain of the chip.

IP Qualification & Verification:
 Proving that every IP block works correctly under real conditions — critical in SoCs.

Physical & Prototype Design:
Designing the actual layout and validating it across PPA (Power, Performance, Area).

Validation:
And then comes validation — the most underestimated, but fastest-growing cost. By the time you hit 2nm, validation alone can cost over $100M — and delays here can cost millions more in missed windows and lost design wins.

Key takeaway:
Designing chips today isn’t just about engineering brilliance — it’s a capital-intensive, multi-disciplinary marathon. And as complexity rises, validation is emerging as the final frontier where projects succeed or fail.

Absolute design power is a concept rooted in predictable power envelopes factoring in known knowns and known unknowns, such as cosmic radiation and soft errrors that can't be predicted, but typical use a known level when fixed speeds are designated for known workloads. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) can be implemented with ADP using a law of averages, however fixed speeds need not be precluded from achieving the aims of a basic ADP architecture.

TDP (Thermal Design Power) of CPUs is a pretty terrible metric that misleads consumers.

In the Pentium era, a 89W TDP meant just that; expect to dissipate 89W of heat in the worst case.

With Alder Lake, a 125W CPU can draw ~241W indefinitely!

Here's the goofy math:
 
 —
 
CPU’s didn’t really know how to idle until the early 2000s. They just kinda ran full bore all the time.

With the introduction of C-States, various parts of the processor could be shut down, saving power when the computer was doing nothing.

Of course, this was HUGE for laptops.

 —
 
If you temporarily downclock a CPU, why not upclock it as well?
 
Around ~2008, Intel came up with the concept of Turbo Boost and the “energy bucket”.

Short spikes *above* TDP are allowed, as long as the 28 second moving average stays <TDP. Okay, nothing too crazy yet.

—
 
In 2013, idle power got really good. CPUs can now downclock to just a few dozen milliwatts!

This ruined the moving average; with such a low idle (~0W), CPUs could now burst to 2x-3x TDP for short periods. 

New metrics, like SDP (scenario design power) get thrown around.

 —
 
2021, things get even worse. The pursuit of performance abandons all previous math.
 
Alder Lake chips can now run at “maximum turbo power” as long as thermal limits aren’t hit. TDP becomes a useless marketing term.
 
An i5, i7, and i9 now all have the same advertised “base power” (~TDP) of 125W. Yet the i5 maxes out at ~150W continuous, the i9 ~241W!
 
The capabilities of these advanced processor states are useful, don’t get me wrong. But the “base power” marketing hurts consumers. 
 
It’s very easy to dilude yourself into thinking that an i5 and i9 can use roughly the same power, when in reality you’ll be 50+% off"

there's also another, lesser used term: absolute design power. I named it "ADP" (p.14/23) https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/10/2/16 & "absolute low minimum power" (p.3/3) w/ fixed speeds: https://img.electronicdesign.com/files/base/ebm/electronicdesign/document/2019/04/electronicdesign_25871_rako_subthreshold_pdflayout.pdf?dl=electronicdesign_25871_rako_subthreshold_pdflayout.pdf

"“Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,” is her Lincoln history published in 2005. It explains how Lincoln placed political rivals, some of whom initially despised him, in his cabinet and molded them into the effective team that guided the nation through the Civil War."

“Lincoln said they were the strongest, most able men in the country,” Goodwin said. “Lyndon Johnson said, `It's better to have your enemies inside the tent p*** ng out, than outside the tent p*** ing in.”' 

[""Lincoln would have said that more nobly](https://www.normantranscript.com/news/local_news/historian-passes-on-abe-lincolns-legacy/article_b89d4fdf-9352-576a-81d4-ca643f91d1ad.html).""

"Intel's treasures, according to Koduri, are its IP and technology, with many innovations left "sitting on shelf." The contrasting snakes, however, are defined as the bureaucratic process that Koruri[sic] sees as dominating corporate decision making, leaving innovation behind.

"The 'spreadsheet & PowerPoint snakes' – bureaucratic processes that dominate corporate decision-making—often fail to grasp the true cost of surrendering performance leadership.

"They optimize for minimizing quarterly losses while missing the bigger picture. These processes multiply and coil around engineers, constraining their ability to execute on the product roadmap with the boldness it requires.

"A climate of fear surrounds any attempt at skunkworks initiatives outside established processes—one misstep, and the bureaucratic snakes strike. This environment has bred a pervasive 'learned helplessness' throughout the engineering ranks, stifling the very innovation culture that built Intel's empire.""

Imagine having a seat at the table that develops laptops. If you're Samsung, Dell, HP, ASUS, Lenovo, you develop laptops. And yet all these laptop makers think making more powerful laptops is always better. To what extent is product design social conditioning?

This [Tumblr post](https://swarmik.tumblr.com/post/164890487174/monochrome-and-color-passive-matrix-lcd-screens) belongs in a museum!  

"640x480 monochrome passive-matrix screens needed about 1.800 transistors to control all pixels (n*2+m for dual-scan). Color active-matrix screens (TFT) with the same resolution needed 300.000 transistors as each pixel is controlled by three transistors (3*n*m). That’s why these screens were so expensive.

Color passive-matrix screens (DSTN) were a good low-cost alternative for everybody who wanted colors “on the road”. This technology needed only about 5.000 transistors for the resolution of 640x480 (2*3*n+m). The result was not exceptional but it was good enough for many productivity applications where slow response rate (300-700 milliseconds) was not a problem.

Unfortunately, quality varied a lot between DSTN screens. Although some had a very crisp picture with shiny colors on par with today’s cheap TN panels, some suffered from significantly poorer contrast, washed colors and color bleeding."

"UPDATE: (1) I was not completely right with the transistor counts – for passive-matrix displays, there will be at least twice as much transistors (one on Vcc and one on GND for each row/column to output both logic levels 0 and 1). (2) I also forgot to mention that passive-matrix screens don’t have transistors in the panel itself. There are special chips on a separate board which makes the solution much cheaper in comparison with TFT (which has multiple layers with tiny transistors inside the panel)."

Ok, do you know what that means? Solar powered laptops might benefit from DSTN panels because they use 1/1000th the transistors (or 1/500th) of active matrix (300,000) depending on his math. I do not know if they required a backlight or constituted part of the backlight, but it is certainly an option that should be explored. Like the AC vs DC wars of the Electric, active matrix won and innovation stagnated in the display industry even while resolution improved- the [technological determinism](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1000/921) of Moore's Law had a parallel in Displays- more (pixel count) were certainly welcome, but diversity of display materials lagged behind (e.g LCD/LED over e-ink and reflective). Intel i series are 15 generations ahead of solar powered calculators, which are 2nd gen (if you count scientific calculators). Displays since the CRTS underwent maybe 5 big transformations in 40 yrs- Green passive matrix screens, LCDs, then LEDs, then OLEDs. But 3 main types today is still less than than 5 options. It would be ideal to have crisp, low power, matte screens (both monochrome and color) that don't require high refresh rates and have low intensity illunination that don't feel like they're blinding the users who feel tethered to a [sunk cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost). 

https://www.blog.baldengineering.com/2024/10/intel-sets-record-with-2d-tmd.html seem like Intel finally disclosed some IP- probably because they expected to get funding for doing nothing. Now of course others are going to try to copy this. But at least the taxpayer isn't treated like a complete idiot and out of the loop.

Interesting to see Congress criticizing Intel. Here's an idea, Intel, restart your Quark series of processors. But this time, include more than 0KB of RAM!

"Intel's CEO steps down
Share
By Emma W. Thorne, Editor at LinkedIn News
Updated 3 hours ago

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the company announced Monday. Current execs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston "MJ" Holthaus will serve as interim co-CEOs until a new chief is named. Gelsinger, who joined Intel in 1979, was "forced out" after the board lost confidence in his plan to revive the struggling chipmaker, Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources. Intel has faced intense headwinds of late, notching a record net loss of nearly $17 billion last quarter and losing its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Its stock is down more than 50% this year."

https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retire-2024-12-02/ " The board told Gelsinger he could retire or be removed, and he chose to step down, according to the source."

Now can someone work on the Claremont/Quark?

"Isaac Asimov supposedly once said “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ but ‘That’s funny…'” https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/03/02/eureka-funny/#google_vignette

"A thematically related passage appeared in 1965 within the London periodical “Science Journal”. An article by British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor discussed the process of scientific discovery:3

The popular picture of the scientist is of a man who is visited by a flash of insight and cries, in effect, “Eureka!” Or, more modestly, as a man who notices something others have ignored and mutters “That’s odd.”

To be realistic, however, the successful scientist often seizes on a new tool or a new technique and applies it sooner than anyone else."

And by sooner, I have direct knowledge of a time when a chemist applied a method sooner than anyone else: Fred Sanger and Carl [Woese](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Biology/blob/main/Woese%20Tribute.pdf)

“[Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger#cite_note-37)'s [rule](https://newsteve.substack.com/p/most-ideas-come-from-previous-ideas)
... anytime you get technical development that’s two to threefold or more efficient, accurate, cheaper, a whole range of experiments opens up.[37]"

The full [quote](https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2019-05/david_schlessinger_transcript.pdf) is:

"I think my feeling was that everything remained in a pilot level, and that it was always important
to be able to walk before you tried to run. So, that we were early enough to continue the
mapping. And again, the question was when the transition point would come. All of us in the
field had been dominated by the development of technology, and everything runs by Sangers
rule; that anytime you get technical development that’s two to threefold or more efficient,
accurate, cheaper, a whole range of experiments opens up. So, the question was, "Would these
be incremental, or completely transformative?" And it turns out that simple changes, like the
development of automatic loaders for capillary electro freezes were enough to start bringing the
cost down and make things feasible on a large scale. Again, it was Sanger and Washington
University, rather than Sanger at that point, who were making decisions for box sequencing. The
real question was the point at which one decided that mapping could be dispensed with. And in
the historical record, I think that's unclear. We did get to the answer, but it wasn't an obvious
choice. The -- how can I put this? The -- one feature of the mapped clones that is -- that remains
and has never been completely exploited, is the fact that they reproduce large sections of the

genome in a form that can be manipulated in a study. So, for example, the A.C. clones we made
at the time remain the only source of a complete factor eight gene, a complete factor nine gene.
These have both commercial and medical implications. And, they're only available by actually
having the clones, which are still achievable in 3D yeast artificial chromosomes at this point.
There's the group led by Vladimir Larionov at NCI, which does recombination-based cloning.
That's got help with that as well. So, that remains something of great interest."

I do not have an institutional position that represents expertise, therefore I am less obligated to make a tidy and neat project. That said, this page could be tidier. It's more a scattered collection of long ruminated thoughts rather than a completely consistent focus. That I joke about many things doesn't detract from the proven technologies demonstrated by others here (and in my [own](https://youtu.be/428cgrpPR0w) [solar](https://youtu.be/0ztj_MDNRcI) [tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeXPXmlq9TQ)). I don't think this project would be possible without a little humor. For those that still don't understand the many contradictions here, it involves some [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), along with the need for [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) as a common form of analysis. I particularly think disbelief also has a lot to do with [agnotology](https://www.optoutproject.net/what-is-true-on-the-internet/), a new word I just learned, but have understood for decades as the study of both willfull and unwitting ignorance/doubt.

Epistemic Knowledge, at Risk from AI Data-Training Poisoning
--
https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-cybersecurity-data-poisoning
https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/data-poisoning/
https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/04/03/generative-ai-data-poisoning-manipulation

Another phrase I learned from the Opt-Out project is "[epistemic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26609249) literacy". Epistemic literacy requires basic knowledge resources- such as researched books and encyclopedias, rather than software that does acrobatic tricks with tens of hops in a traceroute with Chat-GPT. In other words, epistemic literacy requires basic computers (or in Gen-Z speak, _based_ computers) for learning. In retrospect, it makes some of the previous criticism towards the OLPC seem a lot more "cruel pessimism", whereas the "cruel optimism" was a lot more epistemic and not as ahistorical as it seems...

"Learning creates progress when it expands our capabilities to be and to do things that we
have reason to value. As Sen has pointed out, our capabilities are rooted in social, cultural,
and bodily contexts that are not universal. Development is about expansion of these
personal and highly contextual capabilities. Although the debate still goes on about
whether some basic universal human capabilities can be defined,vi in practice progress and
development are deeply subjective and highly idiosyncratic. In the Senian capability-based
approach, this subjective foundation of development is linked to a universal requirement
that valuations are reasonable. They cannot be purely subjective preferences or based on
hedonistic fulfillment; instead, we need to be able make a coherent argument about
valuations that can be accepted as coherent also by those who do not share these values."

_Why is this project important?_ 
--
Reason 1: 

This project would be a joke if it weren't so sad. Academia, Industry, and the Government considers this project so low on the totem pole that if it's on the pole at all, it's under the visible portion. It took 10 years to put someone on the moon, and it's been 13 years since the Samsung[ NC 215S](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-launches-eco-friendly-solar-powered-rechargeable-netbook-nc-215s) laptop was a product. So in a lot of ways, it's harder to put a solar panel on a laptop than it is to put a person on the moon or to explore the [bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jyi07p/eli5_how_is_it_easier_to_send_people_into_space/) of the sea.

Reason 2: [Multitasking...Is](https://youtu.be/Bc9jFbxrkMk?feature=shared) not _that_ important

The second reason, is that it is based on a prediction of computational trends called "[Good enough computing](https://rhombus-tech.net/whitepapers/ecocomputing_07sep2015/#whatisgoodenoughcomputing)" observed from Moore's Law around 2009: The basic observation that I will add, is that most computers, even a quad-core i3 from 2011, is good enough for 80-95% of a user's needs (provided a fast enough solid-state storage device). Not only that, but a user is, as much as a resume or CV is supposed to impress by stating otherwise, not a super multi-tasker. Yes, there are super multi-taskers, and multi-tasking is a skill that many people have, even quite well. But internet use, such as banking, reading, and scholarship are often done serially, in careful analaysis. Thus the limits to multi-core features in enhancing processing is becoming less necessary locally-both on a single mobile device- when it could be on another device in the home and "casting" or on the cloud (if the cloud hoster is trustworthy enough), and it is not removing its utility (fast i7, i9s and Ryzen 9s) altogether, nor should. 

What it is emphasizing, however, is that a smartphone or laptop/monitor with sufficient display resolution- from 480p monitors to 1080p monitors in the mid 00s to 4k monitors in the mid 10s, whether it is a VR headset or goggle, is increasing the _density_ of information for human interaction and productivity, often exceeding the minds ability to interpret, analyze and synthesize feedback. Thus multi-taskers' ability are plateuing for user-interfaces on hardware platforms that do not require that level of inefficiency on [thin-clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client). While I have criticized AR goggles and VR before, the point was never in absolute, but in the prioritization of chip's energy design and software that performs basic information for the markets without as/much access. Granted some of this technology wasn't even possible until a little more than a decade ago, but there is little reason to not prioritize and not optimize a user interface in a smalle power envelope today. Shortly after rockets were developed, the U.S. & the U.S.S.R wasted no time putting them to use...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thZUMaGEE-8 "We can split the atom but not distinguish truth. Our information is failing us | Yuval Noah Harari" 10/18/2024

As computers becoming more powerful in smaller envelopes, one day there might be quad core or even octa-core processors running on microwatts of power and running 10 Chrome tabs, powered by body-heat, RF or solar power. To get there, though, one needs/really ought/should make a Nokia [6110](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r63w_AZi0myfbrHzgzBZSHz2TrVRBPkq/view?usp=sharing) first on solar power.  

Reason 3: 

If you could identify a low-cost, low-risk, information bottleneck that could be commodified as a counter-intelligence operation, would you a: sell it to DARPA, b: do nothing but request a FOIA that takes years after the discovery, or C: educate the public?  

Reason 4:

https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/ "AI Pins “will no longer function as a cellular device or connect to Humane’s servers. This means no calls, texts, or data usage will be possible,” according to the startup, which noted that users can’t port their phone number to another device or wireless carrier. Some offline features “like battery level” will still work, Humane said, but overall, the product will become $700 e-waste for most owners in nine days." 

This could happen to any AI device, including the Rabbit: https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042688/rabbit-r1-ai-gadget-handheld-news-updates-storystream Au contraire, a general purpose processor, such as a 286, still has a use after all those years.

Reason 5:

If smartphones are increasingly becoming a necessity for everything from parking apps, to bar tabs, then a reliable, interoperable smartphone that doesn't run out of power increasingly becomes less a plastic credit card and more a brick out of battery power:

_Hasn't something like this project already been developed?_
--
Yes, but mainly as an unsuccessful [product](https://solarmuseum.org/cells/samsung-nc215s/) or concept.



_Why did this project begin?_ 
--
It's partly inspired by the [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mueller_(engineer)#%22Father_of_the_Space_Shuttle%22) to place someone one the moon by 1970. Also, Steve Jobs designed the 1984 Macintosh as a "computer for the rest of us," according to a [1990 Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNC8LEj5X4U) with [WGBH Boston](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/time-capsule-an-hour-with-steve-jobs-in-1990/246388/). He integrated various technology components that previously only were used in technical laboratories. Tim-Berner's Lee, in 1989, integrated many of the internet protocols that already existed- hypertext - with HTTP:
""In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:
I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web. — Tim Berners-Lee[[32](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids.html)]" 

In essence, it is following in a long tradition of technological [convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_convergence), starting from the integrated [circuit](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/standards-laws/laws/makimotos-wave/) from [Makimoto's wave](https://semiengineering.com/specialization-vs-generalization-in-processors/):

Modified chart from above link

As you can see, this project is not all about computational efficiency at higher power levels. It is about computational efficiency at the lowest power levels possible to run in energy autarkic form factors.

_Why invest in aging architectures and software languages?_
--
Github's own ReadME project has [a lot to say](https://github.com/readme/featured/vintage-computing) about that.

Also,[ Reduce first, then reuse second, THEN recycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_hierarchy). The misconception is often, buy without any long term strategy, dispose, and [naively](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/12/1081129/plastic-recycling-climate-change-microplastics/#:~:text=How%20much%20plastic%20is%20actually,each%20year%E2%80%94a%20paltry%20rate.) think someone else will sort it out. Chances are, the screen of your smartphone isn't cracked, and you're only upgrading it to get a faster processor. If you could mail your phone to a local center or drop it off to an upgrade center that upgrades the chip and memory perhaps or motherboard, you would reduce the cost of manufacturing new screens and cases, if only society believed in a standard mobile form factor _option_. Fairphone is its own ecosystem. One company alone won't be able to do it unless their[ de facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) is popular. What's stopping you from adopting one?

There are more efficient processors out there, which will undoubtedly more practical for low-power, but the timeline to develop such products and develop middleware/emulation/application programming interfaces/ would require thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of coding hours, if it is ever prioritized at all. A simpler solution, for underdeveloped and emerging markets, is to stay the course of the most conventional architectures (ARM [A720E](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-a/cortex-a720) on 2nm, for example would consume how much power at 200 Mhz and 16MB of RAM?). This would allow chipsets to be developed within a few years, rather than more than 5. Without an [Artisanal](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-physical) [license](https://www.anandtech.com/show/18811/intel-ifs-partners-up-with-arm-to-design-socs-on-intel-s-upcoming-18a-node) like those by Apple, Intel and Samsung, amateur chip designers aren't going to have access to the most efficient cores, unless an [open source one](https://iis-projects.ee.ethz.ch/index.php/PULP) is developed.

_Why hasn't this project begun earlier?_
--

It's actually my fault. I got admitted to a university under a College of Liberal Arts and Science program, because I would not have stood a chance if I applied to the Engineering school, which I only had a tangential familiarity and interest at the time. I still haven't learned Linear Algebra and Differential Calculus II, and  I do not have an M.S. or EE after my B.S. (though that didn't stop Steve Jobs from building anything, even without a B.A.) 

It's also likely that industry is more interested in developing products that fit into nice, clean boxes- and claiming that wanting to meet climate goals for carbon emissions is easier by check all the boxes for meeting individual products's carbon footprint, but discourage [Right to Repair](https://www.404media.co/samsung-requires-independent-repair-shops-to-share-customer-data-snitch-on-people-who-use-aftermarket-parts-leaked-contract-shows/) product lifecycles, which collectively can re-use and re-pool parts to the second-hand market. Instead of trying to repair expensive products, it's better to develop a basic platform separate from all of that, one that doesn't create [disposable](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/chromebooks-are-on-average-less-repairable-laptop-analysis-finds/) hobby/edutech waste with incompatible form factors, but can be upgraded over time, piecemeal. 

_How does this project contribute to Gross National Product (GNP)?_
--
For Gross National Product, see this [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp#:~:text=Gross%20national%20product%20is%20one,income%20earned%20by%20foreign%20residents.) for definition. There are other metrics of [Growth](https://www.rostoneopex.com/short-reads/what-are-the-alternatives-to-gdp-as-a-measure-of-growth#:~:text=Alternative%20measures%20to%20GDP%20provide,comprehensive%20assessment%20of%20societal%20advancement.), such as GNH, SPI, and HDI.

The most valuable [exports](https://www.shippingsolutions.com/blog/top-us-exports), according to GDP, is Boeing airplanes, then cars (I think). That much of our economy is dependent on building new iPhones is not good for the environment. If I were in charge, I would put more people to work building cheaper, but quality [homes](https://github.com/hatonthecat/OpenSourceCondo), more jobs, a modern, fully renewable energy grid, more open source cars and body shops for open source cars ([open source cars](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Open-Source-Car/), which could also be exported to other countries (allowing the same quality of [construction](https://www.boxabl.com/) [materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxabl) as the U.S), so that the things that make this country so desirable aren't sold only here. Instead there are students with $200,000+ in student loan debt working at Starbucks because academia has no work for them [counting objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionable_Content) (in an early comic from the 00s) in a laboratory, which would be more productive than cars idling around a block for a drive through (when a dorm could have a cappuccino maker). These projects are far from related- but they represent society's fear of consumerist homogeneity (of material acquisitions and status symbols are important but have less to do with with computers unless one needs to own a Mac or have a [Ferrrari](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GF63-Notebook-Computer-i5-8300H/dp/B07KKMWQL2) logo on a laptop, and cultural homogeneity is less of an actual risk even with increased material homogeneity). Remember [Bobo's in Paradise?](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brooks-bobos.html) Silicon Valley hasn't changed its wish to be bobos, but shifted the cost of living to planned-obsolescence and [techno-feudalism](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/01/has-capitalism-been-replaced-by-technofeudalism), which contributes to [inflation](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-wont-cause-unemployment), of large [things](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Post-scarcity).  

_Is this a profitable product?_
---

The short-term answer is no. The long answer, is it will save millions of consumers billions of dollars over the course of decades. It can result in mild revenue for component manufacturers, but less for vertical designs that are mutually exclusive. For a example a single board computer Foundation could make a tiny board that could fit inside a phone. They could build a SD sized chip, and Gigabyte, ASRock, MSI and Asus could build phone chassis with Innolux and AOC making displays. Established OEMS might benefit, but there is nothing stopping startups from doing so. New and used gas-powered vehicle _sales_ (not usage) are being phased out in some countries and states [by 2035](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/cars/car-news/gas-car-sales-ban). Does anyone plan to be using a cell phone in 2035, or some holographic kinect device that recognizes hand and neural telepathy? It's very likely that phones will still be around in 2035 in a similar form factor, and the market for flip phones and upgradeable chasses, while not huge, still represents an important part of communication infrastructure. The same applies to tablets and laptops. The motherboard is _scalable_. 

_Have I applied to Grants before?_

_How can this project be completed?_
--
There are a number of state-of-the art memory technologies, processors, low power displays and radios out there that can be integrated into a laptop [listed here](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/Hyperlinks.md), which has been updated continuously since 2021. I do not know which combination of components work best, but the [Law of Ergodicity](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/ergodicity-whats-it-mean) suggests each permutation will eventually produce the right combination. I am kidding, of course- it requires an educated analysis to make the fewest number of guesses. Kinda of like a Rubik's cube? I am not a shape rotator- I am a word rotator. Yes, I made that up _too_.
Few, if any companies are integrating them for users. If anything, they are prioritizing AI, because of "shiny thing syndrome." They believe that consumers have too many privileges, and think that solar powered computers are too slow to be worth trying. Or, it is being worked on, but they aren't telling anyone,and could try to milk it for all its worth once i3-i7 patents expire in 99 years (or and if so, will ensure profits for Intel well into the 22nd century) so why should consumers wait another 100 years before anyone realizes it's been possible since ~2011? A handful of academics and companies already have demonstrated it, but ask them one to too many questions and they will ignore it. In 1967, my late professor, Carl Woese was practicing Sanger RNA sequencing at a time when only a handful of people in the world knew the technique. Solar computing is not even a novelty. But you won't hear the media talk about it, because they have no problem airing a bully who says things like:

"They want electric planes. What happens if the sun isn't shining while you're up in the air?" https://substack.com/@introvertcomics/note/c-60467862

If a car can run on solar, a laptop can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYroDMTLVt4 (Not all charging needs to happen simultaneously with usage). Especially with cars, but less of an issue with laptops and phones. With tens of cell phone companies, it is curious why sunlight-readable screens like [Pixel Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Qi) could not have been saved by Economic Recovery Acts (CHIPS, [TARP1](https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-asset-relief-program)&2) when Intel is being bailed out to produce chips domestically (it makes for good campaigning, but little for the end user).

(At least with a little organization and public support with an open source option- like like health insurance- there should be a _public option_ for solar powered tech) Plus, [I'm](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-flight-of-the-weird-nerd-from) also [weird](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs).  I also believe it's hip to be [square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB5YkmjalDg). In 13 years since the Pixel Qi, it remains one of the few manufacturers to ever release a useful screen. The U.S. takes pride over options, but has a weak spot for Apple, Pixel and Samsung phones and those phone makers have never sought to offer a transflective display option. Anjan Katta (who I personally have interacted with, has a much more holistic vision of computing, one that does not treat the display as a second-class component: https://daylightcomputer.com/product His glare-free display is the first major innovation in displays in over 10 years.  Why it took a startup to do that, when Intel, Microsoft, Dell, HP and Apple could not is highly questionable. Kudos to Anjan. 

_Do you think this project is more important than AI?_
--
There are a lot of useful things AI can do, such as for robotics, information sorting & retrieval, and programming, but 10% of most AI VC funding could be diverted to other things and nothing of value would be lost. 

_Isn't an actual space mission (another) more important?_ 
--
There are already programs for that. Congress is spending over [$280 Billion on the CHIPS act](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/unexpected-intel-military-chip-contract-drained-dollar3-billion-from-chips-act-senate-mulls-auction-to-restore-funds), and it's unclear how much of that is [going](https://tomdispatch.com/engelhardt-roads-to-nowhere-ghost-soldiers-and-a-43-million-gas-station-in-afghanistan/) [nowhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel).

"Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries."


However, from https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs :

"The chipmaker just announced it’s downsizing its workforce by over 15 percent as part of a new $10 billion cost savings plan for 2025, which will mean a headcount reduction of greater than 15,000 roles, Intel tells The Verge. The company currently employs over 125,000 workers, so layoffs could be as many as 19,000 people.

Intel will reduce its R&D and marketing spend by billions each year through 2026; it will reduce capital expenditures by more than 20 percent this year; it will restructure to “stop non-essential work,” and it’ll review “all active projects and equipment” to make sure it’s not spending too much."

10,000 jobs created, followed by 15,000 jobs lost = net staff of -5000 jobs. Plus R&D is cut. So there goes the Intel [Claremont](https://bit-tech.net/reviews/tech/cpus/intel-solar-powered-cpu/1/). Have a datacenter? Intel has no problem selling you its Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling technology in orders above 10,000. Create a single core, x86 processor that can run on 5mW? Intel is not interested in your pocket change.

"On May 1, 1969, Fred Rogers, host of the (then) recently nationally syndicated children's television series, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (named Misterogers' Neighborhood at the time), testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Communications to defend $20 million in federal funding proposed for the newly formed non-profit Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was at risk of being reduced to $10 million. Subcommittee chairman, Senator John Pastore (D-RI), unfamiliar with Fred Rogers, is initially abrasive toward him. Over the course of Rogers' 6 minutes of testimony, Pastore's demeanor gradually transitions to one of awe and admiration as Rogers speaks."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quark

Quark powers the (now discontinued) Intel Galileo developer microcontroller board.[3] In 2016 Arduino released the Arduino 101 board that includes an Intel Quark SoC.[4][5] The CPU instruction set is, for most models, the same as a Pentium (P54C/i586) CPU.[6]

Intel announced the end-of-life of its Quark products in January 2019, with orders accepted until July 2019 and final shipments set for July 2022.[1][11] https://linuxgizmos.com/who-killed-the-quark/ 

"Perhaps Intel’s largest impediment was itself. It could never quite decide what the Quark was for and was never able to capture the developer market. The Curie was especially notorious for spotty public documentation and the requirement for signing NDAs to get the full specs.

The low-end chip market is tough going and marked by low margins. Intel had the market clout to succeed, but it was earning such high profits from its popular Xeon and Core chips, the Quark was quickly neglected. To a lesser degree, its Atom line has suffered from the same dynamics.

With IoT morphing into edge computing, and with the dropping costs for Cortex-A53 SoCs, the embedded market is shifting upward. Edge gateways are increasingly asked to process video and do analytics, which need more powerful chips. Still, there’s room at the bottom for more innovation on power-efficient SoCs that can still run Linux."

ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on a large language model, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.[2]

By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $80 billion.[3][4]

”This week, I picked up Max Planck’s classic book, "Where Is Science Going" (Wohin geht die Wissenschaft) and found it incredibly thought-provoking. The book starts with a touching prologue by Einstein, where he speaks highly of Planck’s dedication to science. It's particularly meaningful because Planck was one of the first to recognize the importance of Einstein’s early work and even brought him to Berlin. What really struck me while reading was how much emphasis Planck and his contemporaries placed on the philosophy of science. Today, we see many scientists focusing almost exclusively on numerical simulations and experimental results, often overlooking the deeper questions about nature. In contrast, old school scientists like Planck and Einstein were driven by a curiosity to understand the world, not just to crunch numbers. Maybe this is why we have hit a wall in fundamental physics, or generally, in scientific discoveries. Without a philosophical approach, maybe we are missing the bigger picture. Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in how science was once driven by curiosity.“

"3 Discussion
294 In this paper I scrutinised what we can imply from the single most important result of the Article, namely,
295 what I call here the observed or apparent prediction skill. I demonstrated that it is not indicative of what
296 I regard as the true skill of a data-driven forecast (Fig. 4).
297 Yet, I make the observation that this true skill, the ensemble-wise RMSE, or REMSE, has a persistence
298 – even if short – as the window of data from which the forecast model is inferred is extending/moving with
299 the passing of time (Fig. 3). Persistence always indicates some determinism and, so, predictability [18].
300 Therefore, it would be worthwhile to try to predict the true prediction skill. Interesting questions in this
301 regard might be, e.g.: what (hopefully easily interpretable) states of ENSO are responsible for better or
302 worse skill (especially the horrible spikes of the REMSE seen in Fig. 3 (a)); how long memory of ENSO
303 states does the skill have?
304 The apparent skill evaluated from observations of the unique history of our Earth climate can be
305 useful in comparing models wrt. their predictive power; but also in providing a ballpark figure of skill
306 for a single model. Relating to the latter, I discovered power scaling laws for the ensemble-mean and
307 ensemble-standard-deviation of the apparent skill depending on the observational time series length. The
308 E-mean approaches the climatological skill much faster than the vanishing of the E-std. Unfortunately,
309 though, we have a bottle neck problem regarding the reliability of the ballpark figure of the observed
310 skill: the slow vanishing of the E-std, the variability, would keep our approximation of the climatological
311 skill by the apparent skill uncertain, inaccurate. Mind how the “technological” (ISO 5725) definition of
312 “accuracy” [21] combines the “trueness” (no bias, E-mean) and “precision” (variability, E-std).
313 Finally, I remark that from Fig. 2 (m) of the Article it is unclear if the XROM beats the AI-based
314 model [2] wrt. prediction skill. Indeed, the main contribution of the Article that it offers, instead, as per
315 the title itself, is the explanation of the enhanced prediction skill of the XROM over the ROM. – We have
316 a binary alternative and we were promised to get an explanation for the outcome. However, I do not see
317 much of an explanation why one or the other model – inferred from data – would have better prediction
318 skill. Or we can see the situation in the way that the substance of the explanation is exhausted by the
319 statement of the title. Because if we can take it for granted that some major modes of climate variability
320 can causally influence ENSO, then it should go without saying that the prediction skill of a model that
321 includes those modes – ideally, i.e., regarding the theoretical maximum skill – is better than what has
322 only the local ENSO variables (T, h) (say, the ROM). And I think we can take it for granted, because in
323 a fully coupled system we can know apriori that there is information flow both ways concerning any two
324 state variables; the chances for a one-way flow/coupling, i.e., a master-slave relationship, is zero. It is
325 akin to the situation with, say, a one-sample t-test for the mean of a population in a practical situation,
326 when we know apriori that the null-hypothesis is false, because the chances that it is true are zero. (Thus,
327 if we are not able the reject the null-hypothesis, it is because we do not have enough data.)
328 Much of what the authors present are results in terms of numerical figures for the “contributions”
329 of different modes of variability to the prediction skill. They come up with these by performing three
330 sets of experiments as follows (I quote): “(1) uninitialized experiments (referred to as Uj ), (2) decoupled
331 experiments (Dj ) and (3) relaxation towards observations experiments (Rj )”. Mind that we can speak
332 about “contributions” only if the principle of superposition applies [10], and the authors claim that in the
333 case of the nonlinear XROM “...the uninitialized experiment framework is a suitable approach to quantify
334 the nearly additive relative contributions of each basin to ENSO forecast skill”. It is unfortunate that
335 the authors do not make their exposition in this regard in the context of response theory which is the
336 mathematical basis of the principle of superposition. Thus, we are left unsure what is the forcing and
337 what is the system that responds to a forcing (linearly). Anyhow, what has it to do with the promised
338 explanation?
339 In his monumental yet slim volume “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” [22], Thomas S. Kuhn
340 posits that a theory has only so much explanatory power as predictive power. Had the numerical figures
341 of the said contributions been meant to be explained – which is certainly not what the Article’s title
342 refers to – then there is no such explanation in the Article in the sense of Kuhn. I would be desperate if
343 I was tasked to come up with such explanations, I admit. Vague references to physical processes have no
10
344 chance of suggesting approximate numerical figures for contributions. Making such references to physical
345 processes in an attempt of an explanation is usually called a “handwaving explanation”. I am afraid that
346 this is not what people believe the journal Nature would knowingly target.
347 I do think that the rather achievable task is the explanation promised indeed by the Article’s title, i.e.,
348 explaining the outcome of the said binary alternative. However, I think, it has to do with mathematics
349 rather than geophysics. (See also e.g. how some of the same authors purport to explain [23] a statistical
350 fluke [24], which had been well known to some forecasting experts [17]. And the cherry on top is the
351 anecdote that I shared on Linkedin [25].) Otherwise, as I argued above, any explanation is lacking
352 because we are not so much interested in the theoretical maximum skill, but rather the skill of a model
353 inferred from finite data. Considering that the promised explanation should be mathematical in nature,
354 references to geophysical effects by Zhao et al. are based on hindsight, which could at best be regarded
355 as interpretations – instead of explanations. What are not trivial and remain open questions, waiting for
356 appropriate mathematical analyses, are: why is the overfitting of the X(D)ROM(+) benign (had [20] not
357 actually had it explained already); is there a certain time series length when e.g. the prediction skills of
358 the XROM fitted to 10 time series and the ROM to 2 time series of that same length break even (similarly
359 to the case of the XDROM versus the XDROM+); if so, why that length; why does the XDROM have a
360 memory of roughly only one month; why does e.g. the 2D DROM of any large D have worse skill than
361 the 10D XDROM, D = 1?
362 I would like to point out that I myself did not supply any explanation as to why the XDROM+ can
363 outperform the XDROM only if fed more data than a certain critical amount. I do not quite know yet
364 how to tackle that challenge, actually. A further question that I pose is: why is the AI-based mod
365 completely unable to account for the ingredients of the XDROM+ over the XROM?
366 My critique of Zhao et al. that they did not deliver on their promise implies that the authors misrepre367 sent their merit. (I will not speculate if they do this knowingly or not.) I think their actual merit derives
368 from, ad 1, coming up with the XROM, and, ad 2, providing the numerical figures for the contributions.
369 To me, the former is far more admirable than the rather straightforward analysis of the latter – even
370 if the latter is also genuine scientific novelty given that the contributions cannot be guessed, but one
371 needs to perform calculations to find them out. Otherwise, the latter seems to be used to “beef up” the
372 paper, on the one hand, and to “have a story to spin”, on the other, perhaps out of a sense of insecurity
373 that coming up with the XROM alone is not seen valuable enough by an editor of a “luxury journal”.
374 Unfortunately, I observe a “gold rush” in the Earth sciences where scientists make each other believe
375 that so-called physical explanations are the holy grail of science. (Does the sound of a title “Unravelling
376 the physical mechanism of [*phenomenon*]” ring familiar? Use the word “unravelling”, and you are one
377 step closer to success; if you unravel a physical mechanism, actually or purportedly, then you might well
378 be in, had you ticked other important boxes [26].) Thus, scientists will feed editors and their peers with
379 what they expect. No wonder, then, that in this “echo chamber” a lot of serious issues with the quality
380 of science are overlooked. And the few who could and would point it out often do not have a voice.
381 I think, we see an article here that exemplifies a grave problem with our current system of scientific
382 publishing including – if the manuscript is not desk-rejected [26] – peer review. None of the three reviewers
383 of the Article noticed A.) the said misrepresentation of merit and B.) that the promised explanation will
384 be mathematical not physical. This story turned out so partly because the editor himself is not competent
385 enough, inviting only Earth scientists to reviewing the Article. I think the lesson here is that we need
386 to train ourselves, and the next generation of scientists, to look deeper at problems, and from various
387 angles. Earth scientists too often lack sufficient or even basic mathematical competence [23, 24], let alone
388 some training in philosophy, because of which science evidently badly suffers. I cannot resist pointing out
389 the irony that despite of this trend, the primary scientific title also in the STEM subjects is still called
390 PhD: Doctor of Philosophy."

A Neologism is Coined
--

Enshittification is a term coined by writer Cory Doctorow in **November 2022** to describe a pattern of decreasing quality observed in [online services](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/) and products such as Amazon, Facebook, Google Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber and Unity. The American Dialect Society selected the term as its 2023 Word of the Year. Doctorow has also used the term platform decay to describe the same concept.

History and definition
An Audacious Plan to Halt the Internet's Enshittification by Cory Doctorow at DEF CON 31, 2023
The term enshittification was coined by Doctorow in a November 2022 blog post[1] that was republished in Locus in January 2023.[2] He expanded on the concept in another blog post,[3] which was republished in the January 2023 edition of Wired:[4]

In a 2024 article on ft.com, Doctorow extended the word with the term "enshittocene" to state that "'enshittification' is coming for absolutely everything".[[5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240208152542/https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5)

The beginning of an enshittification era necessitates a parallel internet infrastructure endeavor. Enter Minitel 2W. Local-first, internet where text and encyclopedias are prioritized over Advertisments, Algorithms, and antagonistic partisanship. One where feces is absent. Publically funded internet in the public interest.

For a long time, accepting tax-payer dollars was actually completely acceptable, because it attempted to be non-partisan.

AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio

Senator Pastore: Alright Rogers, you've got the floor.

Mr. Rogers: Senator Pastore, this is a philosophical statement and would take about ten
minutes to read, so I'll not do that. One of the first things that a child learns in a healthy
family is trust, and I trust what you have said that you will read this. It's very important to
me. I care deeply about children.

Senator Pastore: Will it make you happy if you read it?

Mr. Rogers: I'd just like to talk about it, if it's alright. My first children's program was on
WQED fifteen years ago, and its budget was $30. Now, with the help of the Sears-Roebuck
Foundation and National Educational Television, as well as all of the affiliated stations -- each
station pays to show our program. It's a unique kind of funding in educational television. With
this help, now our program has a budget of $6000. It may sound like quite a difference, but
$6000 pays for less than two minutes of cartoons.

Two minutes of animated, what I sometimes say, bombardment. I'm very much concerned, as
I know you are, about what's being delivered to our children in this country. And I've worked
in the field of child development for six years now, trying to understand the inner needs of
children. We deal with such things as -- as the inner drama of childhood. We don't have to
bop somebody over the head to...make drama on the screen. We deal with such things as
getting a haircut, or the feelings about brothers and sisters, and the kind of anger that arises
in simple family situations. And we speak to it constructively.
Senator Pastore: How long of a program is it?

Mr. Rogers: It's a half hour every day. Most channels schedule it in the noontime as well as
in the evening. WETA here has scheduled it in the late afternoon.

Senator Pastore: Could we get a copy of this so that we can see it? Maybe not today, but I'd
like to see the program.
Mr. Rogers: I'd like very much for you to see it.

Senator Pastore: I'd like to see the program itself, or any one of them.

Mr. Rogers: We made a hundred programs for EEN, the Eastern Educational Network, and
then when the money ran out, people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the
fore and said we've got to have more of this neighborhood expression of care. And this is what
-- This is what I give. I give an expression of care every day to each child, to help him realize
that he is unique. I end the program by saying, "You've made this day a special day, by just
your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you, just the way
you are." And I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are
mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health. I think that
it's much hmore dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger -- much
more dramatic than showing something of gunfire. I'm constantly concerned about what our
children are seeing, and for 15 years I have tried in this country and Canada, to present what
I feel is a meaningful expression of care.

Senator Pastore: Do you narrate it?

Mr. Rogers: I'm the host, yes. And I do all the puppets and I write all the music, and I write
all the scripts --

Senator Pastore: Well, I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy, and this is the first time I've
had goose bumps for the last two days.

Mr. Rogers: Well, I'm grateful, not only for your goose bumps, but for your interest in -- in
our kind of communication. Could I tell you the words of one of the songs, which I feel is very
important?

Senator Pastore: Yes.

Mr. Rogers: This has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that children need to
know is there. And it starts out, "What do you do with the mad that you feel?" And that first
line came straight from a child. I work with children doing puppets in -- in very personal
communication with small groups:
What do you do with the mad that you feel? When you feel so mad you could bite.
When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong, and nothing you do seems very right.
What do you do? Do you punch a bag? Do you pound some clay or some dough? Do
you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go? It's great to be able to
stop when you've planned a thing that's wrong. And be able to do something else
instead, and think this song --
'I can stop when I want to. Can stop when I wish. Can stop, stop, stop
anytime....And what a good feeling to feel like this! And know that the feeling is
really mine. Know that there's something deep inside that helps us become
what we can. For a girl can be someday a lady, and a boy can be someday a
man.'

Senator Pastore: I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the
20 million dollars."

If it appears my pet project is vastly incomparable to a public national TV program that needs funding, I beg to differ. Today, public tax dollars are spent on vanity projects that serve special-interest groups without ensuring that the money is not wasted on largely redundant overhead (popups, bloated websites, horrible user-interfaces)

https://userinyerface.com/ A perfect exercise in discombobulation)

The need for a public, no-frills, no-nonsense internet pipeworks should have already been built yesterday. As George Carlin once said "As you swim the river of life, do the breast stroke. It helps to clear the turds from your path."

Solar Computer: A History of Tech Memes:

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-can-it-run-crysis

2007: Crysis [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis_(video_game)) released: But can it run Crysis? 2010: Quake II demo in [browser](https://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1605116&cid=31710240) "But can it run linux?". 2011: But can it run on solar? Intel Claremont runs on Windows 95. 2024: Can it run on solar and is it commercially available? No. 2034 : Can it run on Solar? Who knows? 2044: Can it run Crysis on Solar? Who knows, did they even get Solar linux running yet? 

"About

But Can It Run Crysis? is a phrase referring to the 2007 Crytek first-person shooter Crysis, underscoring the reputation the game has obtained for it's steep system requirements at the time of its release. The phrase has slowly evolved into a snowclone as years pass, substituting "But can it run X?" for the most recent and system-demanding title at the time."

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/snowclone

"About

Snowclones are a type of phrasal templates[2] in which certain words may be replaced with another to produce new variations with altered meanings, similar to the "fill-in-the-blank" game of Mad Libs. Although freeform parody of quotes from popular films, music and TV shows is a fairly common theme in Internet humor, snowclones usually adhere to a particular format or arrangement order which may be reduced down to a grammatical formula with one or more custom variables. They can be understood as the verbal or text-based form of photoshopped exploitables."

Solar Powered Computer is a Snowclone of "But can it run Crysis?" because it expands the template from game/program to operating system, as was done in 2010. 

Mad Libs:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs 

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern[1][2] and Roger Price.[3] It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of Mad Libs books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.[3]

Mad Libs was invented in 1953[4] by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. Stern and Price created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention.[3] No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when Stern and Price were eating Eggs Benedict at a restaurant in New York City. While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor.[3] According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to "ad-lib" an upcoming interview. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be "mad".[3] Stern and Price used that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name "Mad Libs".[3] In 1958, the duo released the first book of Mad Libs, which resembled the earlier games[5] of consequences and exquisite corpse.

Stern was head writer and comedy director for The Steve Allen Show, and suggested to the show's host that guests be introduced using Mad Libs completed by the audience. Four days after an episode introduced "our guest NOUN, Bob Hope", bookstores sold out of Mad Libs books.[6]

In music and other performing arts, the phrase ad libitum (/ædˈlɪbɪtəm/; from Latin for 'at one's pleasure' or 'as you desire'), often shortened to "ad lib" (as an adjective or adverb) or "ad-lib" (as a verb or noun), refers to various forms of improvisation.

The roughly synonymous phrase a bene placito ('in accordance with [one's] good pleasure') is less common but, in its Italian form a piacere, has entered the musical lingua franca (see below).

The phrase "at liberty" is often associated mnemonically (because of the alliteration of the lib- syllable), although it is not the translation (there is no cognation between libitum and liber). Libido is the etymologically closer cognate known in English.

In biology and nutrition, the phrase is used to describe feeding without restriction.[1]" 

"Other performing arts
"Ad-lib" is used to describe individual moments during live theatre when an actor speaks through their character using words not found in the play's text. When the entire performance is predicated on spontaneous creation, the process is called improvisational theatre.

In film, the term ad-lib usually refers to the interpolation of unscripted material in an otherwise scripted performance. For example, in interviews, Dustin Hoffman says he ad-libbed the now famous line, "I'm walking here! I'm walking here!" as "Ratso" Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy (1969). While filming at a streetcorner, the scene was interrupted by a taxi driver. Hoffman wanted to say, "We're filming a movie here!", but stayed in character, allowing the take to be used.[2]"

On a tangent, the phrase was also in Forrest Gump: https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/and66e/in_forrest_gump_1994_when_lt_dan_and_forrest/

Origins of this Project - to my best recollection (and occasionally updated, as recently done here)
---

3/11/2024- Update to my previous "origin" story. In June 2011, Liliputing posted an [article](https://liliputing.com/pixel-qi-suggests-low-power-tablets-could-be-powered-by-1w-solar-panels/) titled, "Pixel Qi suggests low power tablets could be powered by 1W solar panels,"  where I [commented](https://liliputing.com/pixel-qi-suggests-low-power-tablets-could-be-powered-by-1w-solar-panels/#comment-218940429) on the original article. That link I posted was to a 6/2011 [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/04/first-solar-powered-laptop/), documenting an Industrial designer, "[Andrea Ponti](https://www.andreaponti.com/index.html)'s Luce Solar Panel Powered PC." Luce in Italian means "Light." I don't claim to have been the first to have the [idea](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/) for a solar powered laptop. I just want(ed) and (still) want the idea to come to fruition.

I ~~first~~ later conceived of this project after visiting and [reviewing](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/2011%20Maker%20Faire%20%E2%80%93%20Queens%2C%20NYC%20_%20Fujimoto.pdf
) the Maker Faire in 2011, seeing both the Raspberry Pi and a booth with a kit for solar powerable electronics, solar power managers  (similar to Adafruit kits [now sold](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755)) called [BootStrap Solar](https://www.instructables.com/Assembling-a-BootstrapSolar-Chi-qoo-Solar-Battery-/).

I wrote about it weeks [later](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/Theoretically%20assembling%20a%20solar%20laptop%20_%20Fujimoto.pdf). 

A year later I [posted](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/solar-powered%20raspberry%20pi%20with%20fast%20e-ink%20refresh%20display%20-%20Raspberry%20Pi%20Forums.pdf) about it again in [2012](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=206323#p206323).

I resumed interest in 2020 on the Raspberry Pi [Forums](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1753787#p1753787
) after seeing the Solar Gameboy in the [news](https://hypebeast.com/2020/9/battery-free-game-boy-solar-power-northwestern-university): 

This project then migrated across a few informal forum posts (EI2030-defunct, Raspberry Pi Forum), to [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/177716-the-open-source-autarkic-motherboard) in 2021. From there, it has remained, although Github also provides an efficient mechanism for storing and and cloning projects. 

I reached out to universities, companies, and governments in 2021:

No response. While I have met some sympathetic developers, the majority of the industry isn't focused on this product idea, or hasn't shared much publically about it.

But, to put things in perspective, Linux took 8 years to get a kernel (1983-1991), and 21 years for Ubuntu 4.04 to be released.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57c286bb-1614-4be8-a949-f1cf8ba43b5d)

So am I being a bit too optimistic that I haven't amassed an open hardware idea/following/movement that few even understand? Of course! And I shouldn't stop raising awareness of this valuable idea.

According to a recent LinkedIn comment, an x86 license can cost $10b (deleted by the original poster), and a former engineer suggested only Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Nvidia could afford that: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7270536198576582658/

So I am not surprised I got no response. I don't have $10b. I don't even have $1m. Have I been slacking from 2013-2020? Can't say I haven't, but I didn't give the idea much thought- I had other priorities at the time. From 2020 though, I can't say I have been slacking. I imagine if I had a degree from MIT, maybe I might have a few more connections and could have made one phone call and gotten a job in 2020 to work on this quietly for the past 4 years. But I don't have any connections, so I do the next best thing. Raise a stink.

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laurie-kirk_in-1992-andrew-tanenbaum-made-some-predictions-activity-7275640523321696256-TFEs/ (12/19/2024) With more people studying the history of predictions, I'd like to think that the way towards solar powered computers arrive on the most open-minded platform, and that might not be a monolithic kernel:

"_In 1992, Andrew Tanenbaum made some predictions about computing._

_1. Microkernels are the future_
_2. x86 will die out and RISC will dominate the market_
_3. Everyone will be running a free GNU OS._

_An argument ensued between him and Linus Torvalds. But who was right?_


---

_It's all a matter of perspective._

_Microkernels never fully took off, but hybrid kernels like Windows NT, and mach derived kernels found on macOS + iOS control a ton of_ _market share. Linux is the main exception here, being the most monolithic out of the bunch._

---

_As for x86 vs RISC...partial credit._

_x86 obviously still exists, but RISC architectures like ARM completely dominate mobile (and some of the laptop!) market._

_All of the major 7th gen consoles were also running RISC architectures (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii)._

---

_You might be thinking that Tanenbaum got point 3 the "most" incorrect; very few people use GNU Hurd._

_But ponder this:_

_How many operating systems still use GNU userland tools? Tools like Bash, cat, ls, grep, GCC, Make, Tar, and GDB just to name a few._

---

_I'd argue that the majorty of computing systems in the world have at least one GNU-derived (or at least GNU-inspired) tool._

_It's interesting to look back at Tanenbaum's arguments in the modern age. In the early 2000s especially, Tanenbaum seemed quite wrong. It's only recently his arguments have paradoxically gotten more correct."_

In it, I addressed foundry space, and the term "pure play." I examined that while they are "pay to play," they are also potentially and profoundly unequal:

From a recent PC Gamer article ([5/23/2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/apple-reportedly-seeks-to-lock-out-its-competitors-from-tsmcs-2nm-process-by-booking-all-of-its-manufacturing-capacity/
)), "Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple." 

_"According to 9to5mac (via Extreme tech), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise._

_TSMC's 2nm process is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology._

_The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising."_

My predictions were more than a year in advance. Would anyone want one company to reserve all the tooling at a company like TSMC? Hence the word foundry neutrality, similar to net neutrality. It's like when the [FCC steps](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119889/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-rules-restore) in to ensure a minimum wireless spectrum and [internet bandwidth](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/net-neutrality-fcc/) is reserved for for basic internet capability, some quantity of wafers should be reserved for startups to prevent a "too-big-to-fail" FAANG company from reserving 100% control of leading edge semiconductors, lest it be considered a monopoly (not so coincidentally, Apple is being sued by the DOJ for monopolizing the app market: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets It should not be hard to make the connection to hardware that Apple would want the same type of dominance. The tech media could cover that instead of Chat-GPT for once. It might sound like they are catching up to regulation news, after the CHIPS act led to new foundry investments in Arizona.

"it is widely accepted that Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity, at least for a period of time" - the definition of temporary reservations - _"at least for a period of time,"_ can be interpreted widely, because temporary booking of all a node's wafers in a year of production is different from a permanent booking. For example, while it is not technically a monopology on all leading edge foundries (which can include 3nm at Samsung), it still can delay progress in innovation when certain technologies require it. Are chipmakers utilizing 3nm for solar powered phones, and if so, what kind of memory are being used? It is likely that the nodes at 22nm and 12nm are still maturing for logic, SRAM and DRAM, thus there is some improvement that can be make in low-leakage processes such as TSMC-ULL/ULP and Global Foundries FD-SOI. 

https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-computer-chips-taiwan-trade-geopolitics-1605f116

"Your next iPhone won’t be stamped Made in America. But pry open the casing in 2025 and you may see semiconductor chips that were etched into silicon in the Arizona desert." If you're wondering why Apple may be doing business in Arizona soon, it's not because they are as American as Apple Pie. It's because they're being dragged, kicking and screaming, to comply with U.S. regulations (and a tax concession). For a company as callous to produce a [hydraulic press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc) ad, it should be a reflection of the steely heart that the company now is.

Though technically the concept of a solar powered computer existed as a solar calculator before that, which also influenced my interest, I can't think of any time before 2011 that I had wanted to solar power a device like a small PC, although I had been aware of the [OLPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO) since the mid 00s. 

In "A [Conversation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1331287.1331291) with Mary Lou Jepsen What’s behind that funky green machine?" (11/2007, ACM QUEUE), then CTO Jepsen describes the power consumption:

"It’s pretty hot in much of the developing world, so we’ve designed a laptop that can take extreme heat. Part of that is an artifact of it being so low powered. We don’t need big electrolytic capacitors whose lifetimes halve every 10 degrees hotter you get. We get to use little tiny capacitors because we’ve got so little power to deal with, and that’s quite helpful.

Also, half the kids in the world don’t have electricity at home. Half the kids. Eighty percent of the schools that we’re going into don’t have electricity. So we had to design a laptop that was also the infrastructure. It has mesh networking, which is the last mile, 10 miles, 100-mile Internet solution. The solar repeaters and active antennas that we’ve added into the mix cost about $10 a piece and help to relay the Internet. If one laptop in a village is connected to the Internet, they all are.

Yes, it might be just a trickle, a low-bandwidth connection from the Internet to the laptop, but between the laptops is a high-bandwidth connection through the mesh network. We use 802.11s, which is the standard for mesh. The standard isn’t actually complete, but we will be compatible with it when it’s completed. We’ve had to make it up as we go along, so we’re a little ahead of that. There’s truly so little power in the developing world. If a school is wired, it tends to be on a generator, and there’s one 60-watt light bulb per classroom. Generators make really weird power. Usually what comes out of the wall in most countries is 50 or 60 hertz, or somewhere in between. With generators, the frequency of the AC power can go down to 35 hertz. We therefore had to do really interesting power conditioning on the AC adapter. The laptop itself can take between negative 32 volts to 40 volts, and work well with anything from 11 to 18 volts. You can plug a car battery into it. You can plug a solar panel into it."

In early-2023, I recall listening to a audio interview with Richard Barbook https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyoxwUmQBns. Being quite wired to the maker community in the past 15 years, I did not really pay much attention to the political differences of Silicon Valley's origin and European constitutions:

"Unlike its American equivalent, the French revolution went beyond economic liberalism
to popular democracy. Following the victory of the Jacobins over their liberal opponents
in 1792, the democratic republic in France became the embodiment of the ‘General Will’.
As such, the state was believed to defend the interests of all citizens, rather than just to
protect the rights of individual property-owners. The discourse of French politics allows
for collective action by the state to mitigate – or even remove – problems encountered by
society. While the Californian Ideologues try to ignore the taxpayers’ dollars subsidising
the development of hypermedia, the French government can openly intervene in this sector of the economy.46

Although its technology is now increasingly dated, the history of Minitel clearly refutes the
anti-statist prejudices of the Californian Ideologues – and of the Bangemann committee.
The digital future will be a hybrid of state intervention, capitalist entrepreneurship and
DIY culture. Crucially, if the state can foster the development of hypermedia, conscious
action could also be taken to prevent the emergence of the social apartheid between the
‘information rich’ and the ‘information poor’. By not leaving everything up to the vagaries
of market forces, the EU and its member states could ensure that every citizen has the opportunity 
to be connected to a broadband fibre-optic network at the lowest possible price."
https://networkcultures.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/0585-INC_NN10-totaal-RGB.pdf


It is within this context that I see an opportunity for solar powered mobile devices to become the 21st century upgrade from Minitel- a wireless, local-first, decentralized and distributed means to connect the information-poor global economy.

I'm not the best person to manage a project. But I have a clear idea on how to run it. There are far more qualified designers with knowledge about supercomputers from 60 years ago that has not yet even been optimized: https://www.crowdsupply.com/libre-risc-v/m-class/updates/modernising-1960s-computer-technology-learning-from-the-cdc-6600 (RISC-V is actually adopting this old Cray tech now that its utility is being realized)

That said, I have an eye towards user-experience. An engineer like Woz might be a brilliant engineer, but Jobs understood UI far better. What I see to fuse is the minimalist appearance of a laptop like the Luce, with the low power consumption of something like an [Ambiq 510](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ambiq-apollo510-delivers-30x-power-121500335.html). The issue with microcontrollers is that, in using a Cortex M55, it is not designed as an application processor, and there is a scarcity of development in this field, at least public development.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/11/27/the-great-tech-wake-up-call-vcs-discover-billions-in-inefficient-engineering-teams/ For the low price of $100k/year, I am  willing to wear an ankle bracelet 24/7 so you can track my productivity. I'm kidding. Price negotiable. 

Could anyone in the 1940s anticipate Rock and Roll of the 50s, counter-culture in the 60s,  disco in the 70s, electronica/synthwave in the 80s, grunge in the 90's, indie-rock/metal in the 00's, and superpop in 10s? Market research can't predict what the next generation is doing, but there are sometimes hints that counter-culture skips a generation. It could be also what is to explain the rise of the flip phone generation, despite the plethora of octa-core options being given to them by the mega-conglomerates: 

https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/15/business/flip-phone-gen-z-ctrp/index.html

Despite submitting several grant applications, this project exceeds the risk-taking of the Lower-Level Agents:

If there is skepticism from this project, then I am willing to sign a non-profit clause, in that I wish not to be funded, if someone else is willing to steer this project to completion. How else can I prove my sincerity?

Another issue, is the "The agent principal problem" : https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/the-agent-principal-problem

Amount of risk of this project (perceived or real):

The risks may be perceived or real risks. For example, do you believe solar powered computers are possible? If you believe yes, you are correct- solar powered calculators existed since 1976, and solar powered computers have been demonstrated since 2011. If you believe no, then you may not have been around solar powered calculators or computers in your youth. If smartphones were the only thing that one understood as "computers," then their view of history is quite limited. I was surprised, as you may be, to learn that many people who were interested in [radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio#History) before computers were a lot like the hobbysists of today. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Radio_Engineers 

https://spectrum.ieee.org/ham-radio What has changed, however, is that a dependence on a single smartphone for all of one's interaction has caused a clear rejection of the platform by some in Gen Z, due to its near monopoly on attention. Radios and early desktop computers, at least, were offline and did not try to wedge themselves in to every aspect of life. 

An important aspect in science literacy is understanding how things work. A solar calculator allowed a student to believe that a small amount of light could, in fact, power a calculator, using a static [RCA 1802](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1785972#p1785972). In an era where students are all issued Chromebooks for calculators, they are not brought up in the same era where electricity is a privilege, rather than an expectation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802#Programming_languages

"But that doesn’t mean children of the ‘80s, ‘90s, and today are all rushing to make their houses as green as their calculators. Solar calculators may have convinced a generation that the sun could power gadgets, but it’s not the same as convincing them that the power in tiny calculators could stream from an outlet.

The problem, says professor and futurist Cindy Frewen, is that people don’t necessarily think of rooftop panels the same way they might think of consumer electronics. "People adopt their gadgets, but they accept their energy,” she says. “They take it for granted: ‘This is what I have in my house.'"

"Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.

Invention is the mother of necessity.

Technology comes in packages, big and small.

Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.

All history is relevant, but the history of technology is the most relevant.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem

"A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action.[1][2][3] The collective action problem has been addressed in political philosophy for centuries, but was most clearly established in 1965 in Mancur Olson's The Logic of Collective Action.

Problems arise when too many group members choose to pursue individual profit and immediate satisfaction rather than behave in the group's best long-term interests."

"David Hume provided another early and better-known interpretation of what is now called the collective action problem in his 1738 book A Treatise of Human Nature. Hume characterizes a collective action problem through his depiction of neighbors agreeing to drain a meadow"

History on Marketing for Apple

"Of all the great companies of recent memory, there is only one
that seemed to have no character, but only an attitude, a style, a
collection of mannerisms. It constructed a brilliant simulacrum of
character, in the way a man without empathy or conscience can
pretend to have those traits. But it was never really there--even
though two generations of employees convinced themselves
otherwise. It was only when that character was finally tested did the
essential hollowness of the enterprise finally stand exposed, and the
employees and customers shrieked with betrayal.

This was Apple Computer Inc., and there has never been a
company like it. It was founded by two young men, one a genius
with no allegiance to any institution but his own mind; the other a
protean, inconstant figure who seemed composed of nothing but
charm and a pure will to power. The company they built seemed to
have everything: great technology, superb products, talented
employees, rabidly loyal customers, an arresting vision, even a lock
on the zeitgeist. But, like its founders, it lacked character. And
because of that, from the first minute of the first meeting of Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak, a decade before the company's founding,
Apple Computer was set on a path from which it could not escape,
even after those founders were gone. And that path would in time
lead to the company's destruction.

More than any other great company, the seeds of Apple's future
glory and its subsequent humiliation were planted long before the
company ever began. And bend and prune as it might, Apple
Computer could never free itself of its roots.

2.0 SEED

It was Regis McKenna, the Silicon Valley marketing guru, who first
saw the horrible truth: "The mistake everyone makes is assuming
that Apple is a real company. But it is not. It never has been."
He was too much of a businessman (after all, Apple could prove
to be a once and future client) to draw the final inference: "And it
never will be."

Nobody alive knew Apple better than Regis McKenna--at least
nobody who had been affected by the notorious "reality distortion
field" that emanated from Steve Jobs;. After fifteen years of
handling the company, Regis had remained unwarped and
unconverted because no matter how successful Regis McKenna Inc.
had become, and no matter how far it had left the publicity game
behind for the more rarefied climes of marketing and business
development, Regis still remained a PR man at heart. He still upheld
the flack's first law: never, ever believe the hot air you put out about
your client.

Not that it was easy. When you watched your client land on the
cover of Time magazine and knew you got the credit for getting him
there; when you stood in the convention centers and giant
auditoriums and felt the waves of adoration rolling around you; and
when the calls came late at night and you heard Jobs the Seducer
telling you how much he depended upon you, it would have been so
simple to surrender to the undertow, to lose yourself in the Apple
Will.

But every time Regis thought of doing so there would be a
meeting to remind him that Apple was a kind of collective madness.
He would bring in an expert on marketing, or branding, or
organizational theory--anything that might give the company some
order, some strategic planning, some simulation of real business
discipline--and he would watch in dismay as that person was
humiliated, ignored or driven away. As for his own advice--well,
nobody blew off the mighty Regis McKenna. Instead, they'd listen
intently, nodding, foreheads pinched in concentration, even the
seraphic Jobs himself making those unreadable and delicate motions
with his fingers on the tabletop as if he was taking seriously what
Regis was saying ... and then the Apple Corps would leave the room
and never think about Regis's message again.

In the end, after fifteen years advising the company he'd helped to
create, McKenna walked away from Apple Computer. And not just
from Apple, but from PR itself"

https://youtube.com/watch?v=0OlEHIAIWn4 "No experience in life is wasted as an artist if remembered and used later" 

by that logic, Steve Jobs was an artist - calligraphy in the Macintosh.

"Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later."

"Looking back, some have questioned whether Apple's board of directors could have done more to retain Steve Jobs in 1985. Sculley himself later acknowledged Jobs' effective leadership and called him "the best CEO ever," admitting that he underestimated Jobs' visionary potential at the time. The firing of Jobs also raises questions about the board's decision-making and overall company strategy. Could they have chosen different approaches or members to better handle the situation?"

"Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth - that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible." -Max Weber

"No worthwhile human achievement has ever been instigated on the basis of demonstrable cost effectiveness." - Adrian Bowyer

My Github draft got lost because I accidentally cancelled a tab closing and undid a nearly complete commit, but I had written a substantial paragraph on how cost is a secondary consideration in the progression of inventions, citing Bowyer, but also analyzing Xerox's Chuck Thacker and Apple's Woz "middle stage" adaption of IBM/PDP (e.g. 945/360, PDP-6) systems into novelties-  portable Compaq-like consumer tech (though they weren't the only ones- as [Landley.net](https://landley.net/notes.html#28-10-2023) has a better history on that- he mentions Paul Allen and Mitch Kapor, which I read much less into, but that they had identified that complexity was no longer the only drafting stage.): 

"The bestselling computer in the world was the PDP-8 from 1973 until it was displaced by the Apple II around 1979, and in its entire production run the PDP-8 sold a grand total of around fifty thousand units EVER, meaning there was no consumer base for a "software industry" before microcomputers. Most software before that was either produced by hardware manufacturers bundling software with the hardware they sold, or by local staff maintaining an installation, or collaborations like produced Multics. What little commercial software got created was bespoke development tailored to specific installations because there was no other business model yet due to a lack of customers to sell to. (Not a lot of speculative development when your total potential worldwide market for PDP-6 software was 23 machines, you talk to them FIRST and get paid before putting in the engineering time, and then you DO the work on their hardware because you haven't got one.) The first computer to sell a million units was the Commodore VIC 20 at the end of 1982, and "the computer" was Time's man of the year for 1982. The Apple vs Franklin legal battle happened when it did because a shrinkwrap software finally had a potential customer base THAT YEAR. People fought over the money once there actually was money."

To focus on two engineers:

" The obvious difficulty in this method--the only method the engineering world had known until recently--was that the more complex the problem, the more complicated the hardware setup needed to address it. In this world, the most gifted engineers were those who could puzzle out novel ways to reduce the number of components by, say, 10 percent. And it was in this particular type of simplification that Woz had shown almost supernatural talent." from Infinite Loop (1999) by Michael Malone https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/malone-loop.html

from [The Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895) and the Dawn of the Computer Age Paperback – (1999) by Michael A. Hiltzik (Author)

A careful review shows that they both understood that cost reduction was the future of Silcon Valley (and since PARC was primarily focused on 10-year long research & dev, the marketability of the Xerox Star would arrive too late, thus Jobs accelerated development by completing their menu screen and cost reduction, as stated by Jobs in an interview in 1990 to the WGBH Boston: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk  

To tie this back to the hypothesis stage, the phrase "talk is cheap" isn't to devalue talk, but to acknowledge that cost is an important factor in even the exploratory stage. And therefore "talk is cheap" is another way of rapidly prototyping (hence Bowyer's RepRap concept) various iterations of expensive ideas in a way that doesn't require actually making them all, but rather exchanging them either via market surveys/research, forums, or prior product feedback to discover market or business inefficiencies in both availability of products and underserved markets which sometimes actually have viral, general purpose applications after passing through the [Gartner hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle). In other words, "Think Rich" is not delusions of grandeur, but it's an inalienable right to discuss concepts and products as ideas cannot be patented, something that creative people do not often have a shortage of (and sometimes are better off working on multiple projects if they have [writers block](https://www.hottakes.space/p/accessing-your-creative-reserves)/engineer's block)

The cost of prototypes, toys, and research, are, according to Byrne Hobart, "But there's a feature of the outside world that also has a major impact: solutions-in-search-of-a-problem and toys-in-search-of-real-world-use are both less costly and more valuable in a world of lower real interest rates."

Form Factors
--


I had written something in my draft about I/O shields, and how many new SBC boards such as Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi and even AMD, could share more similar [form factors](https://hackaday.io/page/21232-platos-ideal-world) to support even long-side backplates (as in AMD's case)  if they developed something like a mini i/o shield (1/6 scale perhaps).

This little "cosmetic" detail could support more reusability and dual-use integration into laptops such as the PiTop, which do not require major modification of chassis if the rectangular I/O shield can be limited to a narrow segment of the chassis. As mentioned in my mobile-ITX [blog](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/Mobile-ITX%20and%20ATX-like%20standards%20for%20SBCs%20and%20mobile%20motherboards.pdf) post, degrees of freedom are a chemistry concept that chemist know more about, and architects of SBCs have far more leeway into rearranging components that do not require convoluted overpasses of wires above heatsinks to reach the backplate I/O.

"The [cubane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubane) name derives from the cube-shaped geometry of the molecule. Since carbon normally bonds at angles of 109.5 degrees, the forced 90-degree angles of the cube framework introduce a high degree of strain into the molecule—so much so that prior to Eaton’s seminal synthesis, most chemists and theoreticians deemed the very existence of the molecule impossible.

“Not only did Phil synthesize cubane, but he did so by a very creative strategy that used photochemistry to excite the molecule into a cage structure and a ring contracting reaction to attain the desired carbon framework,” said Rawal."

Influences
-----

I think it's important to not understate my early influences. When I was an undergraduate majoring In Biology, my introductory organic chemistry class had a lecture on synthesis of chemical structures. "“To this day, it’s a landmark. If you look up a textbook on organic synthesis, Eaton’s cubane synthesis will be showcased,” said Prof. Viresh Rawal, Eaton’s colleague and chair of the UChicago Department of Chemistry. “It is often used to demonstrate the power of chemical synthesis and the ingenuity that such molecules inspire.”'

As I reflect on my research interests, I can't help but think of comparing the relatively boring field of chemistry to the hot field of semiconductors (it's obvious who gets all the press).

“Phil said one thing to me that I remember to this day,” said Chuan He, Eaton’s colleague and the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry. “He said: ‘So many people work on natural products; I decided to work on unnatural products.’ I think that captures the essence of the University of Chicago. We strive to work on things that are different, unique or sometimes unpopular.”

Semiconductors are unnatural products, so what difference does it make on which types of electronics are paired together? 

If you browse though all my repositories, you may notice a pattern.

All this time, I've been trying to "pack" efficient components- be it pre-built linux distros such as DietPi into 256MB RAM or hardware (currently in the concept stage) into a box- or you could say a cube. But this cube is a circuit design, for a PCB.

The atoms C (Carbon), N (Nitrogen) represent components. The traditional PCB sees power input on a 2D planar- (not in the literal sense, but figurative). A flat compound is cyclohexene (of [cycloalkenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloalkene)). Consider the aromatic double bond the circuit where electricity flows. This is considered the "traditional" PCB. Now, the era of [3D stacked memory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4556747) is popular. PCBs have always had layers (2, 4, 6, etc), but power is usually viewed in a 2-dimensional plane (in that it is a given that it is an input, but rarely makes any consideration into the source of that power, and what type of PCB is needed for it to work.

![image](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/27706e69-141a-4d02-a518-36fc38ae4ee0)

from https://github.com/TUDSSL/ENGAGE#system-design-game-boy-emulation-and-system-state-checkpointing

In other words, the design of engineering is capable of thinking in 3D terms when it comes to memory and CPU (e.g. Ryzen 7 [5800X3D](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d)), so why not solar [power](https://e-peas.com/product/aem10941/) integration? Energy harvesting shifts the utility of the design into what can be perceived as having to "work" to generate power, because holding a tablet or phone to collect sunlight would appear to be a "chore" for the consumer. But that is not really a universal belief.

Some manufacturers are "subtly" including solar charging into products again:

![image](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/e6d45003-16cc-4ff4-9342-8b0e6e981e7f)

Most technological development involves some amount of efficiency advancements for it to be marketable. What this project seeks to do, is integrate all of those highly efficient technologies into one "cube." You can call it disruptive, in the same way [cubane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubane) can be considered disruptive.

"The resulting high energy density means a large amount of energy can be stored in a comparably smaller amount of space, an important consideration for applications in fuel storage and energy transport."

By integrating a high efficiency solar DC-DC charger, such as the TI [BQ24074](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755): "Automatic charging current tracking for high efficiency use of any wattage solar panel"...

...and the most efficient microcontroller in terms of microamp per megahertz (uA/mhz), the Ambiq Apollo4, you have a very compact "box." One that can be shipped. 

Step 1: Design Box

Step 2: ???

Step 3: Ship Box. Profit $$$

Carbon, Meet Nitrogen (or hydrogen, take your pick). I didn't invent this pairing. Countless others before me actually built a working prototype. I'm just explaining the trend. Now a cube requires 10 bonds (plus 8 more for H) (C8H8). To ship this "box", it needs a display. Enter memory in pixel. For it to be ubiquitous, it probably needs a long-range modem, such as LoRa or nB-IoT.

So far that's only 4. But enough for a diagram:

![image](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/533e9896-1697-4729-8128-9ec58e889ac9)

It just so "happens" that ~~Moore's~~ [Koomey's Law](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/1885_Demonstration_Model.jpg) has progressed to a stage where the amount of power on a small solar panel is enough to power all four of those components. Powering a keyboard, mouse/touchscreen, and/or voice recognition are additional challenges, but the basic circuit has been described.

The bi-directional flow of the electricity in a cubic circuit isn't meant to be taken literally- it would need to follow the standard solar charging circuit designs (or anyother energy harvesting circuit).

If you think this project impossible, then it's like saying cubane is impossible. 

On a side note, the phrase "be there or be [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(slang))" originated in the 1940s:

"The sense of square as a derogatory reference to someone conventional or old-fashioned dates to the jazz scene of the 1940s; the first known reference is from 1944. There it applied to someone who failed to appreciate the medium of jazz, or more broadly, someone whose tastes were out of date and out of touch."

So there you have it - cubane is to jazz as flat pcbs are to "being square".

-----

Porting linux or BSD to a microcontroller would require a lot of effort, yet it seems the path of least resistance when compared to trying to develop a sub 30nm application processor designed for extremely low power consumption (less than 2mW. With the Apollo4 Plus running at 4uA/mhz, that presents a fast enough processor for basic applications while still retaining a low power profile. 

One of the first goals is to select an OS that would be versatile to basic, low-RAM applications. Another step would be to have a bootloader, via buildroot or Yocto development. a third step would be to run the current application only in RAM.

"Its embedded 4.75MB of memory delivers power-efficient display performance by storing images on-chip to avoid exhausting resources by fetching data from external memory.' https://embeddedcomputing.com/technology/iot/wireless-sensor-networks/ambiq-enables-audio-radio-and-graphics-for-always-connected-iot-endpoints

One of the key differences from this project and the Raspberry Pi is that micro-SD loaded OSes like Raspberry Pi OS are extremely slow, and do not compare to the true, baremetal capabilities of even the armv6 in the Raspberry Pi Zero. loading Raspup Buster 8.2.1  or Tinycore linux on a Raspberry Pi 3 on 512 MB RAM runs faster on RAM than loading apps from microSD.

The early Nokia phones had immediate response times when navigating the Symbian OS. The modern operating systems of today adopt an omnibus of kernel modules, that prevent replicating the user experience of earlier phones and desktops. Phones attempt to run at even faster speeds to keep up with the hundreds of processes, yet lag behind the simplified OS of a generation ago.

What would be ideal is to focus efforts on operating systems that feature HMI and userspace applications while retaining the benefits of the RTOS task scheduling. An analogy would be the UDP vs TCP comparison. UDP is a connectionless protocol- it does not require connections to restart after losing a byte to a corrupt transmission packet. Rather than have hundreds of process IDS waiting to be completed, the user could wait for a kernel task to complete, and if not busy, the syscall could complete the user's request. I call it the "use it or lose it" concept. Which the kernel would be programmed to skip a task that would take too long to process. It would be better to have real time notifications of kernel tasks (likea sysmonitor) rather than an hourglass (or no indicator at all) to observe system health- this would significantly benefit microcontrollers that have limited RAM (2-4MB usable).

Another focus is to perhaps limit the amount of POSIX compliance in an OS to further reduce OS size. 

A third focus is compatibility with plug and play screens that do not emit a backlight, to save power and to reduce eyestrain.
A reflective display with a variable refresh rate- 1-30hz, toggled by the user, would be a desirable feature in such a system.

The addition of solar panels is would certainly be a goal, but would need to be implemented at a later stage.

**Hardware:** Redboard Artemis, SAMD51, Dialog 14695, ESP32, STM32, other MCUs/MPUs with can be used, including ones with E-paper already connected, like M5Paper, or LILYGO® TTGO T5.

Looking for:

"At this point, we need other people interested in the idea of this super-low-power device with its “I’m not a regular laptop” aspiration. You can help us figure out the key important areas for us to focus on. No special skills needed! If you like the sound of such a device, email us and join! No required time-commitment and no contribution is too small and no worries of all of this microcontroller-type talk goes over your head. We need you!"


If you do have experience (and it is welcome), these fields are of particular help:

This may sound like a purely high-tech project (read: hard/inaccessible), but it is not, since leading edge hardware/tech is now available in the open-source community. The Sparkfun company (which makes the Artemis boards with Apollo3) helped changed that perception, because if NASA used Sparkfun's altimeter, then it means open-source tech can (and has been) designed to be both leading tech and accessible. Other technology companies like Adafruit, Digikey & Mouser also provide high-quality electronics to non-business entities (i.e hobbyists).

This avenue (Cortex A series processors, as opposed to Cortex M0 or M4) has rarely been developed for, due to the likely power needs of the most performance-hungry apps.


**Items:** Microcontrollers, e-paper display (no minimum resolution, but should be capable of displaying terminal)

For a microcontroller, microprocessor, display, external memory/storage, and OS to be considered for this project, it must meet the Power First-Design approach: [https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/wiki/tri-design-approach.md] (Link reverted to prevent broken links).

A newsletter at Substack has a great piece on the early days of Xerox PARC, called ChipLetter:
https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/chip-letter-links-no-21-xerox-parc Part of it is paywalled, but there is substantial content, including a reference to LA Times writer Michael Hiltzik in his 1999 book, "The Dealers of Lightning". Written just 1 year before the dot com bubble burst, a biography on a company with such unfettered access to frank employee interviews today would be highly unusual, as brands have many more trade secrets to protect in an ultra-competitive market. Nonetheless, the book reads with a much more activist tone than the fluff today in the Wirecutter section of the NYT. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#The_GUI

6-12-2024 Real Tech Journalists cover Science & Engineering too

https://www.404media.co/elon-musk-tweeted-a-thing/ "If we want journalism to survive we need to move away from the model where dozens of humans write the same exact blog about an errant Elon Musk tweet in hopes of appeasing an algorithm that is actively changing to kill this exact business model" -Jason Koebler

Of the few human journalists remaining at major news outlets, they are forced between choosing to cover thinly veneered promotional reviews while the benefiting from association with an established institution name/Trademark like the NYT or Wired (some would call it "legacy media," which is admittedly offensive even to myself), which might have access to some advanced SEO tools (or would be foolish for not trying), and covering a story that is not even on the algorithmic radar. Someone could discover then next gen fusion reactor, and tech wouldn't cover it because they wouldn't be able to explain it to their audience (but have no problem using the phrase mansplainer and tech bro when ridiculing Silicon Valley). So which will it be, BigMedia, educating readers about basic science concepts or debating the minor details about which new product you should or should not buy (while plugging in nearly every model of the company you're covering).

https://slate.com/technology/2025/02/ed-zitron-interview-big-tech-ai-criticism.html "Oftentimes Zitron takes aim not just at the tech companies trafficking in an A.I.-focused vision for the future but the media organizations and star technology reporters that cover them. Some journalists believe in covering A.I. as an ongoing and potentially larger breakthrough with profound, dangerous ramifications for society and enormous profit potential for tech companies. Then there is a sizable camp, of which Zitron is one of the most prominent members, that reacts with deep skepticism and hostility to the tech industry’s embrace of A.I and messaging around it."

100 years of Hobbyism

Hobbits engaging in hobbyism (smelting a ring in a volcano to prevent Smeagol from finagling)

Several years ago, an article which went virtually unnoticed still rings true https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/160225-solar-calculator-history-energy-objects Children from the silent generation grew up with [Erector sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erector_Set) as a hobby. Before the internet, tinkerers from the baby boom era spent plenty of time working with antennas to build radios out of transistors. The Generation X and early Millenials are probably the only two generations that grew up with pocket-sized calculators, which cost more than $400 in the early 1970s. By the late-90s, cell phones began integrating all of these features into the first multimedia smartphones, and the ease of access to computing made hobbyism less about access to basic information and more about high-speed social media.

A little bit of a handicap encourages each generation not to become super dependent on convenience. Call it the most basic pc. My first PC came with a CD pack that included an Encyclopedia (MS Encarta '95). Before that, home bookshelves had [encyclopedias](https://www.publicbooks.org/the-encyclopedia-project-or-how-to-know-in-the-age-of-ai/) in many homes. Portable computers are even more capable of being multi-featured PCs in even less of a thermal design power/envelope (TDP), and the focus of journalism has often been "we're covering all the new features of a product release- let us educate you, and throw away your old pc (we wouldn't know what to do with it- linux? what's that?"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCdDKPonXXA <- 1996 PC that had more information than an empty internet device today

Hyperbole asides, A balanced tech media like the Wired, The Verge, Ars Technica, ExtremeTech would cover 10% software, 10% hardware, 10% Superconductors, 10% particle physics, 10% climatology, 10% astrophysics, 10% biology, 10% culture/politics, 10% business, and 10% pure mathematics (you can see where my bias leans, some of this was humor-intended). Instead it's 95% leading FAANG company releasing incremental product/feature XYZ.
