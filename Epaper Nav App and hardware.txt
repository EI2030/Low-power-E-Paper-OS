E-Paper Map Navigation apps and hardware platforms are an area worth exploring- The sun glare can cause screens to be hard to see. Some very interesting projects:

An idea I had was to use a microcontroller based navigation software to a very pared down 2D navigation software, something like the 2000 era Tom Tom and garmin devices. An Ambiq Apollo 4 has 192 mhz of RAM, and perhaps the extra storage could fit an offline map.
