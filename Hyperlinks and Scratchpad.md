#Notes

This project has a lot of goals, but it can only accomplish a few goals at a time. To better elucidate what this project is, I think it is best to ask oneself, What is a Low-Power OS?

To start, it could be any level of low-power, since power consumption is a relative term. It could refer to 0.5mA consumption, 0.5mA, 5mA, 50mA, 500mA, or 5A. 

Therefore, before it is possible to organize a group around a low power OS, it is best to select a thermal power envelope before embarking. 

I will select 0.5mA for the MCU alone (96mhz@ 4uA/mhz= 384uA)= Turbo Speed  (192mhz) is 768uA.

Finding the available tools and hardware is the first half of the battle. Before starting this project, I did a few Google searches- "solar powered cpu"  by doing this, I was able to unearth a lot of research from early 2011: https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/31745-intel-shows-solar-powered-cpu-experiment/ 
https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/16/claremont_near_voltage_processor/
"Near-threshold voltage" (and near-threshold computing) are terms rarely used in the mainstream market. 
The origins of NTV are earlier, from the Phoenix processor: https://news.umich.edu/microchip-sets-low-power-record-with-extreme-sleep-mode/ 

https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~teodorescu.1/download/slides/radu_cmu_may2013.pdf

But what if not every person needed an app that uses lots of bandwidth and cpu utilization? See this article for reference: 
http://rhombus-tech.net/whitepapers/ecocomputing_07sep2015/

At least one company in recent news claims to operate an application processor in the NTV range: http://www.micromagic.com/news/eeNewsAnalog_Santoro_Interview.pdf

https://github.com/kragen/dernocua/blob/master/intro.md 

http://canonical.org/~kragen/dernocua/dernocua-020211231.pdf 

The current issue here is that there is not much demand right now. However, as more research and development goes into products that can easily be recharged by solar, the demand to avoid long charging cycles for app-hungry phones will increase. Instead of waiting for an application processor to be released using NTV, it may be more practical to port linux to the Ambiq Apollo4, which uses  Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology: https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/microcontrollers/article/21800524/subthreshold-cortexm4f-design-sips-less-power-than-cortexm3 With the Apollo4 being released Q2 2021, Ambiq has lowered uA/mhz from 30uA/mhz in the Apollo1 to 3uA/mhz in the Apollo4. Furthermore, Sparkfun's Artemis boards which use the Apollo3 running 6uA/mhz, use so little power than I was able to solar power the LED for an Adafruit boost charger, along with the Red and blue power LEDs on the Artemis.

Furthermore, the definition of "high-tech" and "low-tech" is due for a re-examination: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech This subject will be examined more in detail in a future analysis.

Solar Powered Webserver: https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/06/rebuilding-a-solar-powered-website/ Lowtech Magazine recently benchmarked the website generation times for their solar powered website, and has compared the generation times between Hugo and Pelican:

"The times displayed are the average time of three runs on both the solar server (an A20 processor with two 1 GHz cores and 1 GB of RAM) and a modern laptop (an Intel i7-8650U Processor with four cores at 1.9 GHz and 32 GB of RAM). Generating the Hugo site on the solar server without cached assets is not possible to do in one go because the process either runs out of memory or exceeds the timeout limit of Hugo. In that case, the command has to be run several times in a row. While it seems as if Hugo is slower than Pelican on the laptop, that is likely explained by the Hugo site running both a dithering logic and another compression logic for the images. In Pelican, images are only dithered and originals not recompressed.

Hugo	                                                             Pelican

Recently encountering an actual copy of Paint Shop Pro, I was relieved to find a very simple image image tool that calculates the size of the converted file prior to conversion. For example, a 1MB 24-bit color file could be converted to 16 colors and 50KB, drastically reducing the page loading times for simple content. This can be one of the most convenient tools for generating webpage content, and doesn't require using guesswork in MSPaint or websites that do the conversion for you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro

I also was able to select 1 bit dithering, which converts 24 bit into monochrone (Black and white), but quite well, along with 16 color. It compressed a 1MB file to 50KB using 16 colors and dithering. 

In this example, it converts a 4.45MB file into a 706KB 1-bit file:

Original: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_Sforzesco#/media/File:20110725_Castello_Sforzesco_Milan_5557.jpg

Opting for 4 color, one can achieve a slightly more balanced palette at just 1MB:

Opting for 16-color, one can compress the file to 2.6MB:

Using Optimized Octree, the image can be reduced to 1.7MB (page 65 of user manual)

![image](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/20004778-4de6-4fd1-accf-2d88dde8530f)

While JPEG can compress the file quite a bit more, the quality can appear quite degraded. Nonetheless, I was able to compress the file to just 95KB:

![20110725_Castello_Sforzesco_Milan_5557 100](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/d74b0d5c-0e92-40d5-aef0-4d8a2191d01c)


While there are many other tools and formats that may be able to achieve higher compression rates with far less loss in quality (e.g. webp, APNG), a simple tool like the above can allow file attachments to be sized under the limits of many applications and sites (25MB, 10MB, etc).

Wikipedia's own resized files are better compressed while still maintaining good color and resolution. It can be argued that certain images preserve more information with fewer colors and a higher, uncompressed resolutions (e.g. in cases where outlines are more important than palette such as pencil marks in Paint). However, some files may require special codecs that are not always viewable (e.g. JPEG2000 codec, not applicable here).

Some e-paper manufacturers such as Waveshare sell 7-color displays, which have a low refresh rate, but allow dithering in a way that can actually create rich colors (600x448 Inky Impression 5.7 by Pimoroni): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daO46JaVHOs

While the larger sizes look great on larger monitors, it will not be as portable on smaller screens, especially ones that do not need large previews. Resizing to 25%, shrunk the original file to 63KB, and the dithering was only 3KB less, using 4 color dithering (60KB): Whether it would be less costly to produce displays with fewer colors is unclear, since much of the LED technologies are mature. The power consumption of displays is an avenue that would be far more benefiecial for a low power computer than the number of colors. That said, Many of the monitors prior to the 1990s had at least 256 colors, and were still quite capable.

Similar to greyscale and black and white film, dithering can look sharper, if only the relevant colors are displayed. While the 24-bit color file is far more balanced in terms of colors and pixel accuracy, it can appear softer and less sharp:

Saving a webpage often takes far longer than the number of bytes per second as depicted here:

https://superuser.com/questions/1745770/saving-webpages-on-chrome-takes-longer-than-expected-and-downloaded-filesize-is
Since most sites have a folder of scripts to download when saving a cached page, the page will download much slower than an advertised ISP's speeds (in the tens/hundreds or Gbps). Having a faster harddrive (such as PCI-e Gen3 or Gen4) will help with the 4KQD1 random write speeds for the small script files it needs to save the page to disk, but a far simpler solution would be for the page to minimize its scripts needed to display, at least for a non-Javascript version. Thus static site generators, or very simplified dynamic site generators can fit the bill far better when designed well. https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo

"Testing and developing physical embedded systems is difficult due to poor reproducibility and lack of insight into the current state of a system, especially in multi-node scenarios.

Renode addresses this issue by letting you run unmodified binaries identical to the ones you would normally flash onto their target hardware on a virtual board or system of boards.

One important aspect of the tool is that it simulates not only CPUs but entire SoCs (e.g., heterogeneous multicore SoCs and various peripherals) as well as the wired or wireless connections between them, allowing users to address complex scenarios and test real production software."

Plan 9 and related Resources
----
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs

"A later retrospective comparison of Plan 9, Sprite and a third contemporary distributed research operating system, Amoeba, found that
the environments they [Amoeba and Sprite] build are tightly coupled within the OS, making communication with external services difficult. Such systems suffer from the radical departure from the UNIX model, which also discourages portability of already existing software to the platform (...). The lack of developers, the very small range of supported hardware and the small, even compared to Plan 9, user base have also significantly slowed the adoption of those systems (...). In retrospect, Plan 9 was the only research distributed OS from that time which managed to attract developers and be used in commercial projects long enough to warrant its survival to this day.

It was licensed for manufacture by an array of semiconductor companies. In 2009, it was one of the most widely used ARM cores, and is found in numerous deeply embedded system designs.

Texas Instruments licensed the ARM7TDMI, which was designed into the Nokia 6110, the first ARM-powered GSM phone.[3] This led to the popular series of Nokia phones using the processor, including the 3210 and 3310.[4]" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyERJx51fgM

FreeRTOS is one of the common OSes used on Ambiq Micro. The advantage to using FreeRTOS over uClinux is a smaller kernel:
https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS_Support_Forum_Archive/November_2016/freertos_Free_RTOS_Memory_Management_59ed41adj.html
The disadvantage is more development time. However, with limited onboard flash & RAM, a microkernel would provide lower power consumption than a larger linux kernel, unless using an older linux kernel such as 2.4, but since there would be security risks with an older kernel, its functionality would be limited to off-line use. See https://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:pxe#why-use-pxe-the-vnc-example
https://tiny.slitaz.org/index.php Using a uClinux version for Cortex M4 may have advantages, provided there is enough space for individual apps.

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/234286.1057828  "the early history of smalltalk"

"By now it was already 1979, and we found ourselves doing one of our many demos, but this time for a very interested audience: Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin, and other technical people from Apple. They had started a project called Lisa but weren't quite sure what it should be like, until Jef said to Steve, "You should really come over to PARC and see what they are doing." Thus, more than eight years after overlapping windows had been invented and more than six years after the ALTO started running, the people who could really do something about the ideas, finally got to to see them. The machine used was the Dorado, a very fast "big brother" of the ALTO, whose Smalltalk microcode had been largely written by Bruce Horn, one of our original "Smalltalk kids" who was still only a teen-ager. Larry Tesler gave the main part of the demo with Dan sitting in the copilot's chair and Adele and I watched from the rear. One of the best parts of the demo was when Steve Jobs said he didn't like the blt-style scrolling we were using and asked if we could do it in a smooth continuous style. In less than a minute Dan found the methods involved, made the (relatively major) changes and scrolling was now continuous! This shocked the visitors, especially the programmers among them, as they had never seen a really powerful incremental system before.

Steve tried to get and/or buy the technology from Xerox (which was one of Apple's minority venture capitalists), but Xerox would neither part with it nor would come up with the resources to continue to develop it in house by funding a better NoteTaker cum Smalltalk.

VI. 1980-83—The release version of Smalltalk (-80)
"The greatest sin in Art is not Boredom,
as is commonly supposed, but lack of
Proportion" — Paul Hindemith

As Dan said "the decision not to continue the NoteTaker project added motivation to release Smalltalk widely." But not for me. By this time I was both happy about the cleanliness and elegance of the Smalltalk conception as realized by Dan and the others, and sad that it was farther away than ever from the children—it came to me as a shock that no child had programmed in any Smalltalk since Smalltalk-76 made its debut. Xerox (and PARC) were now into "workstations" as things in themselves—but I still wanted "playstations". The romance of the Dynabook seemed less within grasp, paradoxically just when the various needed technologies were starting to be commercially feasible—some of them, unfortunately, like the flat-screen display, abandoned to the Japanese by the US companies who had invented them. This was a major case of "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Larry Tesler decided that Xerox was never going to "get it" and was hired by Steve Jobs in May 1980 to be a principal designer of the Lisa. I agreed, had a sabbatical coming, and took it." - Alan Kay

https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/196379/understanding-the-apple-1-power-supply

https://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/kottke.html "The Altairs, the Cromemcos, all of that generation were heavy metal boxes. It was brilliant of Steve to find Rod Holt to make a switching power supply, which was a lightweight power supply with no big heavy transformers, and to put the plastic case on it.

So you could actually take the Apple ][ under your arm and carry it somewhere. We never really advertised that but it was part of the appeal. And Steve never forgot that."

"You can trace the portability aspect into the Macintosh, which had a handle built right into it; that was pretty obvious. Steve also paid a lot of attention to and took a lot of inspiration from Hartmut Esslinger, the founder of Frog Design. The mouse for the Lisa was by Frog Design and they were mocking up Macintosh cases for us in 1982. Then Steve left Apple and Apple lost its way into a profusion of beige boxes.

If you remember the history the next big thing on the landscape was the Macintosh IIcx. That was a highly modular, highly manufacturable computer and that was a landmark. But it wasn't about portability and it wasn't about industrial design, it was about manufacturability. At the same time Compaq was a big success making the PC highly manufacturable and highly modular, and so the Mac IIcx was kind of Apple's answer to that."

Portablility, manufacturability, and now power consumption (with the new possibilities due to to Koomey's Law) remain the three most imporant design considerations. 

1990 "A Bicylcle of the Mind" https://youtu.be/L40B08nWoMk?t=869 "Well, the Macintosh, when it first came out, we called it the computer for the rest of us." -Steve Jobs, with a grin, 1990.

"“You can’t be neutral on a moving train,” I would tell them. Some were baffled by the metaphor, especially if they took it literally and tried to dissect its meaning. Others immediately saw what I meant: that events are already moving in certain deadly directions, and to be neutral means to accept that.”
