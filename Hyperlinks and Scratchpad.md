#Notes

This project has a lot of goals, but it can only accomplish a few goals at a time. To better elucidate what this project is, I think it is best to ask oneself, What is a Low-Power OS?

To start, it could be any level of low-power, since power consumption is a relative term. It could refer to 0.5mA consumption, 0.5mA, 5mA, 50mA, 500mA, or 5A. 

Therefore, before it is possible to organize a group around a low power OS, it is best to select a thermal power envelope before embarking. 

I will select 0.5mA for the MCU alone (96mhz@ 4uA/mhz= 384uA)= Turbo Speed  (192mhz) is 768uA.

Finding the available tools and hardware is the first half of the battle. Before starting this project, I did a few Google searches- "solar powered cpu"  by doing this, I was able to unearth a lot of research from early 2011: https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/31745-intel-shows-solar-powered-cpu-experiment/ 
https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/16/claremont_near_voltage_processor/
"Near-threshold voltage" (and near-threshold computing) are terms rarely used in the mainstream market. 
The origins of NTV are earlier, from the Phoenix processor: https://news.umich.edu/microchip-sets-low-power-record-with-extreme-sleep-mode/ 

https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~teodorescu.1/download/slides/radu_cmu_may2013.pdf

But what if not every person needed an app that uses lots of bandwidth and cpu utilization? See this article for reference: 
http://rhombus-tech.net/whitepapers/ecocomputing_07sep2015/

At least one company in recent news claims to operate an application processor in the NTV range: http://www.micromagic.com/news/eeNewsAnalog_Santoro_Interview.pdf

https://github.com/kragen/dernocua/blob/master/intro.md 

http://canonical.org/~kragen/dernocua/dernocua-020211231.pdf 

The current issue here is that there is not much demand right now. However, as more research and development goes into products that can easily be recharged by solar, the demand to avoid long charging cycles for app-hungry phones will increase. Instead of waiting for an application processor to be released using NTV, it may be more practical to port linux to the Ambiq Apollo4, which uses  Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology: https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/microcontrollers/article/21800524/subthreshold-cortexm4f-design-sips-less-power-than-cortexm3 With the Apollo4 being released Q2 2021, Ambiq has lowered uA/mhz from 30uA/mhz in the Apollo1 to 3uA/mhz in the Apollo4. Furthermore, Sparkfun's Artemis boards which use the Apollo3 running 6uA/mhz, use so little power than I was able to solar power the LED for an Adafruit boost charger, along with the Red and blue power LEDs on the Artemis.

Furthermore, the definition of "high-tech" and "low-tech" is due for a re-examination: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech This subject will be examined more in detail in a future analysis.

Solar Powered Webserver: https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/06/rebuilding-a-solar-powered-website/ Lowtech Magazine recently benchmarked the website generation times for their solar powered website, and has compared the generation times between Hugo and Pelican:

"The times displayed are the average time of three runs on both the solar server (an A20 processor with two 1 GHz cores and 1 GB of RAM) and a modern laptop (an Intel i7-8650U Processor with four cores at 1.9 GHz and 32 GB of RAM). Generating the Hugo site on the solar server without cached assets is not possible to do in one go because the process either runs out of memory or exceeds the timeout limit of Hugo. In that case, the command has to be run several times in a row. While it seems as if Hugo is slower than Pelican on the laptop, that is likely explained by the Hugo site running both a dithering logic and another compression logic for the images. In Pelican, images are only dithered and originals not recompressed.

Recently encountering an actual copy of Paint Shop Pro, I was relieved to find a very simple image image tool that calculates the size of the converted file prior to conversion. For example, a 1MB 24-bit color file could be converted to 16 colors and 50KB, drastically reducing the page loading times for simple content. This can be one of the most convenient tools for generating webpage content, and doesn't require using guesswork in MSPaint or websites that do the conversion for you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro

I also was able to select 1 bit dithering, which converts 24 bit into monochrone (Black and white), but quite well, along with 16 color. It compressed a 1MB file to 50KB using 16 colors and dithering. 

In this example, it converts a 4.45MB file into a 706KB 1-bit file:

Original: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_Sforzesco#/media/File:20110725_Castello_Sforzesco_Milan_5557.jpg

Opting for 4 color, one can achieve a slightly more balanced palette at just 1MB:

Opting for 16-color, one can compress the file to 2.6MB:

Using Optimized Octree, the image can be reduced to 1.7MB (page 65 of user manual)

![image](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/20004778-4de6-4fd1-accf-2d88dde8530f)

While JPEG can compress the file quite a bit more, the quality can appear quite degraded. Nonetheless, I was able to compress the file to just 95KB:

![20110725_Castello_Sforzesco_Milan_5557 100](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/assets/76194453/d74b0d5c-0e92-40d5-aef0-4d8a2191d01c)


While there are many other tools and formats that may be able to achieve higher compression rates with far less loss in quality (e.g. webp, APNG), a simple tool like the above can allow file attachments to be sized under the limits of many applications and sites (25MB, 10MB, etc).

Wikipedia's own resized files are better compressed while still maintaining good color and resolution. It can be argued that certain images preserve more information with fewer colors and a higher, uncompressed resolutions (e.g. in cases where outlines are more important than palette such as pencil marks in Paint). However, some files may require special codecs that are not always viewable (e.g. JPEG2000 codec, not applicable here).

Some e-paper manufacturers such as Waveshare sell 7-color displays, which have a low refresh rate, but allow dithering in a way that can actually create rich colors (600x448 Inky Impression 5.7 by Pimoroni): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daO46JaVHOs

While the larger sizes look great on larger monitors, it will not be as portable on smaller screens, especially ones that do not need large previews. Resizing to 25%, shrunk the original file to 63KB, and the dithering was only 3KB less, using 4 color dithering (60KB): Whether it would be less costly to produce displays with fewer colors is unclear, since much of the LED technologies are mature. The power consumption of displays is an avenue that would be far more benefiecial for a low power computer than the number of colors. That said, Many of the monitors prior to the 1990s had at least 256 colors, and were still quite capable.

Similar to greyscale and black and white film, dithering can look sharper, if only the relevant colors are displayed. While the 24-bit color file is far more balanced in terms of colors and pixel accuracy, it can appear softer and less sharp:

Saving a webpage often takes far longer than the number of bytes per second as depicted here:

https://superuser.com/questions/1745770/saving-webpages-on-chrome-takes-longer-than-expected-and-downloaded-filesize-is
Since most sites have a folder of scripts to download when saving a cached page, the page will download much slower than an advertised ISP's speeds (in the tens/hundreds or Gbps). Having a faster harddrive (such as PCI-e Gen3 or Gen4) will help with the 4KQD1 random write speeds for the small script files it needs to save the page to disk, but a far simpler solution would be for the page to minimize its scripts needed to display, at least for a non-Javascript version. Thus static site generators, or very simplified dynamic site generators can fit the bill far better when designed well. https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo

A Samsung DDR SDRAM 64 Mbit chip

In the late 1980s IBM had built DRAMs using a dual-edge clocking feature and presented their results at the International Solid-State Circuits Convention in 1990.[6][7]

Samsung demonstrated the first DDR memory prototype in 1997,[1] and released the first commercial DDR SDRAM chip (64 Mbit) in June 1998,[8][2][3] followed soon after by Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) the same year.[9] The development of DDR began in 1996, before its specification was finalized by JEDEC in June 2000 (JESD79).[10] JEDEC has set standards for the data rates of DDR SDRAM, divided into two parts. The first specification is for memory chips, and the second is for memory modules. The first retail PC motherboard using DDR SDRAM was released in August 2000.[11]

"Samsung Electronics Co. now has commercial samples available for the 16M Double Data Rate Synchronous Graphics Random Access Memory (DDR SGRAM) chip, which is receiving attention as a next-generation, super-fast graphics memory device, the company announced on September 16.
The samples are being shipped to makers of dedicated graphics controllers.
According to the company, this product supports graphic images at up to 286Mbps, twice the speed of the regular 16M SGRAM."

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/62132/ 

Abstract:
"A high-speed 16-Mb DRAM chip with on-chip error-correcting code (ECC), which supports either 11/11 or 12/0 RAS/CAS addressing and operates on a 3.3- or 5-V power supply, is described. It can be packaged as a 2-Mb*8, 4-Mb*4, 8-Mb*2, or 16-Mb*1 DRAM, And is capable of operating in fast page mode, static column mode, or toggle mode. Speed and flexibility are achieved by a pipeline layout and on-chip SRAMs that buffer entire ECC words. The use of redundant word and bit lines in conjunction with the ECC produces a synergistic fault-tolerance effect.< >
Published in: IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits ( Volume: 25, Issue: 5, October 1990)"
Page(s): 1118 - 1128 DOI: 10.1109/4.62132

Using the SGRAM rate, could deliver 35.75Mbps per single 2Mb DDR chip

Maximum frame buffer using least overhead? Perhaps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer 

On an STM32F7-Discovery microcontroller: 

"The screen is 480x272, so if we want to use a 4-byte pixel format, it will need about 512KB of RAM. Our chip has 320kB RAM, so we have to use external RAM. On the other hand, we can use the 16 bits per pixel format, so less than 256KB of RAM is required, and therefore we can try to use the internal RAM."

https://alexkalmuk.medium.com/a-little-about-graphics-subsystem-internals-on-microcontrollers-d952cfd0966a 

Who needs 32bit? The [MIP is 8 color](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/lineup_from_draft_rev3_jdi_gr_mip_reflective_color_lcd_and_standard_products_20180219-3.pdf) (1bit SRAM per pixel)

https://www.adafruit.com/product/4694 Adafruit 2.7" 400x240 SHARP Memory Display Breakout- "The display is 'write only' which means that it only needs 3 pins to send data. However, the downside of a write-only display is that the entire 400x240 bits (13.5 KB) must be buffered by the microcontroller driver. That means you cannot use this with an ATmega328 (e.g. Arduino UNO) or ATmega32u4 (Feather 32u4, etc). You must use a high-RAM chip such as ATSAMD21 (Feather M0), Teensy, ESP8266, ESP32, etc. On those chips, this display works great and looks fantastic."

54KB Video RAM could produce quite a large resolution - 1600x960 at 1 bit-write only. Read and write might need double, or more. Add in a couple bytes and could still be less than 2Mb DDR chip.  

AMD's :
https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/infinity_fabric
The DRAM is attached to the DDR4 interface which is attached to the Unified Memory Controller (UMC). There are two Unified Memory Controllers (UMC) for each of the DDR channels which are also directly connected to the SDF. It's worth noting that all SDF components run at the DRAM's MEMCLK frequency. For example, a system using DDR4-2133 would have the entire SDF plane operating at 1066 MHz. This is a fundamental design choice made by AMD in order to eliminate clock-domain latency.

CAKE
The workhorse mechanism that interfaces between the SDF and the various SerDes that link both multiple dies together and multiple chips together is the CAKE. The Coherent AMD socKet Extender (CAKE) module encodes local SDF requests onto 128-bit serialized packets each cycle and ships them over any SerDes interface. Responses are also decoded by the CAKE back to the SDF. As with everything else that is attached to the SDF, the CAKEs operate at DRAM’s MEMCLK frequency in order to eliminate clock-domain crossing latency.

"Infinity Fabric (IF) is a proprietary system interconnect architecture that facilitates data and control transmission across all linked components. This architecture is utilized by AMD's recent microarchitectures for both CPU (i.e., Zen) and graphics (e.g., Vega), and any other additional accelerators they might add in the future. The fabric was first announced and detailed in April 2017 by Mark Papermaster, AMD's SVP and CTO."

"4 x 1MB = 4MB, 45ns, FPM, Simm-30 Memory Modules are now available.

I also managed to beat my 386 overclocking record with 0WS at 51.2MHz."

Early 90s RAM had speeds around 30-50Mhz.

https://websrv.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/mpr/MPR/ARTICLES/061404.pdf "Unlike the ARM610, the ARM250 has been qualified for operation at 3V. The newer chip uses about 21
mW per MHz at 5V, or 250 mW at 12 MHz. When
throttled down to 3V, power consumption goes down to a
miserly 90 mW. Although much of the chip is fully static,
portions of the IOEB are not, limiting the ability to save
power by reducing the clock speed.
This low power consumption is primarily due to the
minimal transistor count. The CPU core requires just
over 29,000 transistors, and the entire ARM250 uses
less than 100,000. The chip is built in a conservative 1.0-
micron CMOS process with two layers of metal. The die
(see Figure 3) is just 58 mm2. The ARM250 uses a 160-
pin Japanese PQFP (PJQFP)."

Foundry

https://semiwiki.com/events/342309-intel-direct-connect-event/ 

"It was interesting to see Arm’s CEO Rene Haas on stage with Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger. Arm was described as Intel’s most important business partner, and it was noted that 80% of parts run at TSMC have Arm cores. In my view this shows how seriously Intel is taking foundry, in the past it was unthinkable for Intel to run Arm IP."

This is analogous to Apple in the 90s  licensing Microsoft Office and offering support for Microsoft products, as the latter supporting iTunes and realizing they could make more business as partners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvhW8cp15tk

"Testing and developing physical embedded systems is difficult due to poor reproducibility and lack of insight into the current state of a system, especially in multi-node scenarios.

Renode addresses this issue by letting you run unmodified binaries identical to the ones you would normally flash onto their target hardware on a virtual board or system of boards.

One important aspect of the tool is that it simulates not only CPUs but entire SoCs (e.g., heterogeneous multicore SoCs and various peripherals) as well as the wired or wireless connections between them, allowing users to address complex scenarios and test real production software."

Plan 9 and related Resources
----
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs

"A later retrospective comparison of Plan 9, Sprite and a third contemporary distributed research operating system, Amoeba, found that
the environments they [Amoeba and Sprite] build are tightly coupled within the OS, making communication with external services difficult. Such systems suffer from the radical departure from the UNIX model, which also discourages portability of already existing software to the platform (...). The lack of developers, the very small range of supported hardware and the small, even compared to Plan 9, user base have also significantly slowed the adoption of those systems (...). In retrospect, Plan 9 was the only research distributed OS from that time which managed to attract developers and be used in commercial projects long enough to warrant its survival to this day.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mmi-pd/ from a Slack thread:

At least they have:
"Prebuilt binaries for Linux, Sparc-Solaris, and HP-PA."
I hate having to build on Solaris and HPUX. :zany_face:

  3 years ago
I tried to rebuid , (prebuilt binaries are for 32 bit, my system is 64 bit linux), however the distribution is really old, there are even pre-ANSI C files...so there are lot of edits to be done...

  3 years ago
I looked into it, but I think even pulling out a 2004's vintage 32-bit Linux, this would be very challenging.  There's no documentation on how to build it (just incoherent bits and pieces) and there's a lot of interdependencies. After a few hours it seemed unlikely that the 20+ year old code base would be valuable enough to merit this pain (and TCL should be wiped from all known universe). (edited) "

https://opencomputeproject.github.io/ODSA-BoW/bow_specification.html

"" In your implementation you have to enable low-frequency operation so you can interoperate with devices that, by the nature of the process node, cannot go to 60 megabit per second. Some things need to stay at low data rates. They can interoperate with these circuits.”"
https://semiengineering.com/is-ucie-really-universal/"

https://semiengineering.com/chiplets-more-standards-needed/ "Analog data is often digitized with a specific bit width. This is based on the signal and application and, in many cases, is not a multiple of 8 bits. Current standards, however, work on the basis of multiples of 8 bits. Obviously, bit padding can be used to make the data in the protocols conform to the standard, yet such space-filling bits do not contain any information, which means that a large portion of the data transfer rate is wasted. By implication, then, further standards must be created for applications in the field of heterogeneous integration, or existing standards must be extended to cover these kinds of specifically analog interfaces."

Sounds like the RISC-ification of data/wire power efficiency? As the instructions in RISC were optimized to send as much data in as fewest cycles possible. Similarly the electrical signals in a PCB may be wasting excess signal padding to transmit relatively small amounts of data without low-bandwidth only wire sizes.

from: https://www.landley.net/writing/mirror/fool/todo/rulemaker000224.htm 

"A man named Seymour Cray came up with the big new idea in the high end. It was called a "RISC" design, which is an acronym for "Reduced Instruction Set Computing." A RISC instruction set is simplified, with each instruction in it taking only one clock cycle to complete. The older designs were full of complicated instructions that took many clock cycles, and thus the acronym "CISC" (standing for "Complex Instruction Set Computing") was retroactively invented to describe them.

In a RISC design, the more complicated tasks that took many clock cycles to complete were broken up into smaller pieces, and each individual step the processor did per clock cycle was given its own instruction number. (Since these were basically the steps the chip had to do behind the scenes anyway, this wasn't necessarily much of a change. The new instruction set was simply more explicit.) In addition, each instruction was made the exact same length, which means that on a 32-bit chip each instruction would be exactly 4 bytes long.

By itself, these changes merely reduced the complexity of decoding variable-length instructions, and allowed the instruction execution circuitry to be streamlined a bit. Not major wins. But this also opened up a whole new avenue for optimization, which is called "pipelining."

Basically, you build two complete sets of the instruction execution circuitry on the same chip. These two copies are called "Processor Cores," or "Pipelines." Since each instruction is the same length, the chip doesn't have to finish decoding the first instruction to see where the second one starts. Each clock cycle, the second pipeline can look at the instruction immediately following the one the first CPU core is executing, and if the second instruction doesn't depend on any results of the first, the second core can execute the second instruction then and there, in the same clock cycle. Under ideal circumstances, the processor can literally execute two instructions each clock cycle. When circumstances aren't ideal, the second pipeline pulls a "wait state," just like the clock-doubled 486 (described yesterday) did when it ran out of prefetched instructions in the cache.

Since the end of the previous paragraph was pure, unadulterated technobabble, I'd like to step back and demonstrate the idea using a portion of a recipe to represent a computer program:

Measure 1 cup flour
Add flour to mixing bowl
Count 2 eggs
Crack eggs into bowl
Mix
If you'll notice, a lot of instructions depend on the results of previous instructions. You can't put the flour in the bowl before you've measured it; you can't crack the eggs before you've counted them; and you can't mix the ingredients before they're both in the bowl. But other pairs of instructions are independent, such as adding the flour to the mixing bowl and counting the eggs. If a second set of instruction execution circuitry is looking over the first's shoulder, the flour can be put in the bowl and the proper number of eggs selected at the same time, basically counting as only one step.

It works even better if the program is re-ordered to pair off independent instructions, like so:

Measure 1 cup flour
Count 2 eggs
Add flour to mixing bowl
Crack eggs into bowl
Mix
Now the measuring and counting can be done in one step, and adding both ingredients to the bowl can be done in a second step, followed by mixing. From taking five steps to finish, now the process only takes three. This is a tremendous speed improvement, achieved by rethinking and reorganizing the processor's instructions so that more transistors can be thrown at the problem to do more stuff at the same time, in parallel.

Of course, RISC had some downsides. Without the variable instruction length trick central to CISC instruction sets, programs took up much more memory. The chip also required twice as many transistors for two complete processor cores, which meant it took up twice as much space on the silicon wafer, which made it twice as expensive to manufacture. And RISC programs had to have their instructions in the right order to take full advantage of the second processor core, which required more advanced program development tools that weren't available when the first generation of RISC chips hit the market. But like all optimizations, the trade-off was considered worth it if you could execute two instructions per clock cycle, even part of the time."

FreeRTOS is one of the common OSes used on Ambiq Micro. The advantage to using FreeRTOS over uClinux is a smaller kernel:
https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS_Support_Forum_Archive/November_2016/freertos_Free_RTOS_Memory_Management_59ed41adj.html
The disadvantage is more development time. However, with limited onboard flash & RAM, a microkernel would provide lower power consumption than a larger linux kernel, unless using an older linux kernel such as 2.4, but since there would be security risks with an older kernel, its functionality would be limited to off-line use. See https://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:pxe#why-use-pxe-the-vnc-example
https://tiny.slitaz.org/index.php Using a uClinux version for Cortex M4 may have advantages, provided there is enough space for individual apps.

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/234286.1057828  "the early history of smalltalk"

"By now it was already 1979, and we found ourselves doing one of our many demos, but this time for a very interested audience: Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin, and other technical people from Apple. They had started a project called Lisa but weren't quite sure what it should be like, until Jef said to Steve, "You should really come over to PARC and see what they are doing." Thus, more than eight years after overlapping windows had been invented and more than six years after the ALTO started running, the people who could really do something about the ideas, finally got to to see them. The machine used was the Dorado, a very fast "big brother" of the ALTO, whose Smalltalk microcode had been largely written by Bruce Horn, one of our original "Smalltalk kids" who was still only a teen-ager. Larry Tesler gave the main part of the demo with Dan sitting in the copilot's chair and Adele and I watched from the rear. One of the best parts of the demo was when Steve Jobs said he didn't like the blt-style scrolling we were using and asked if we could do it in a smooth continuous style. In less than a minute Dan found the methods involved, made the (relatively major) changes and scrolling was now continuous! This shocked the visitors, especially the programmers among them, as they had never seen a really powerful incremental system before.

Steve tried to get and/or buy the technology from Xerox (which was one of Apple's minority venture capitalists), but Xerox would neither part with it nor would come up with the resources to continue to develop it in house by funding a better NoteTaker cum Smalltalk.

VI. 1980-83—The release version of Smalltalk (-80)
"The greatest sin in Art is not Boredom,
as is commonly supposed, but lack of
Proportion" — Paul Hindemith

As Dan said "the decision not to continue the NoteTaker project added motivation to release Smalltalk widely." But not for me. By this time I was both happy about the cleanliness and elegance of the Smalltalk conception as realized by Dan and the others, and sad that it was farther away than ever from the children—it came to me as a shock that no child had programmed in any Smalltalk since Smalltalk-76 made its debut. Xerox (and PARC) were now into "workstations" as things in themselves—but I still wanted "playstations". The romance of the Dynabook seemed less within grasp, paradoxically just when the various needed technologies were starting to be commercially feasible—some of them, unfortunately, like the flat-screen display, abandoned to the Japanese by the US companies who had invented them. This was a major case of "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Larry Tesler decided that Xerox was never going to "get it" and was hired by Steve Jobs in May 1980 to be a principal designer of the Lisa. I agreed, had a sabbatical coming, and took it." - Alan Kay

The true innovation of the Apple I (1976)

http://www.righto.com/2012/02/apple-didnt-revolutionize-power.html

https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/196379/understanding-the-apple-1-power-supply

https://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/kottke.html "The Altairs, the Cromemcos, all of that generation were heavy metal boxes. It was brilliant of Steve to find Rod Holt to make a switching power supply, which was a lightweight power supply with no big heavy transformers, and to put the plastic case on it.

So you could actually take the Apple ][ under your arm and carry it somewhere. We never really advertised that but it was part of the appeal. And Steve never forgot that."

"You can trace the portability aspect into the Macintosh, which had a handle built right into it; that was pretty obvious. Steve also paid a lot of attention to and took a lot of inspiration from Hartmut Esslinger, the founder of Frog Design. The mouse for the Lisa was by Frog Design and they were mocking up Macintosh cases for us in 1982. Then Steve left Apple and Apple lost its way into a profusion of beige boxes.

If you remember the history the next big thing on the landscape was the Macintosh IIcx. That was a highly modular, highly manufacturable computer and that was a landmark. But it wasn't about portability and it wasn't about industrial design, it was about manufacturability. At the same time Compaq was a big success making the PC highly manufacturable and highly modular, and so the Mac IIcx was kind of Apple's answer to that."

Portablility, manufacturability, and now power consumption (with the new possibilities due to to Koomey's Law) remain the three most imporant design considerations. 

1990 "A Bicylcle of the Mind" https://youtu.be/L40B08nWoMk?t=869 "Well, the Macintosh, when it first came out, we called it the computer for the rest of us." -Steve Jobs, with a grin, 1990.
