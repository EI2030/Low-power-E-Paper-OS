Finding the available tools and hardware is the first half of the battle. Before starting this project, I did a few Google searches- "solar powered cpu"  by doing this, I was able to unearth a lot of research from early 2011: https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/31745-intel-shows-solar-powered-cpu-experiment/ 
https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/16/claremont_near_voltage_processor/
"Near-threshold voltage" (and near-threshold computing) are terms rarely used in the mainstream market. 
The origins of NTV are earlier, from the Phoenix processor: https://news.umich.edu/microchip-sets-low-power-record-with-extreme-sleep-mode/ 


But what if not every person needed an app that uses lots of bandwidth and cpu utilization? See this article for reference: 
http://rhombus-tech.net/whitepapers/ecocomputing_07sep2015/

At least one company in recent news claims to operate an application processor in the NTV range: http://www.micromagic.com/news/eeNewsAnalog_Santoro_Interview.pdf

The current issue here is that there is not much demand right now. However, as more research and development goes into products that can easily be recharged by solar, the demand to avoid long charging cycles for app-hungry phones will increase. Instead of waiting for an application processor to be released using NTV, it may be more practical to port linux to the Ambiq Apollo4, which uses  Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology: https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/microcontrollers/article/21800524/subthreshold-cortexm4f-design-sips-less-power-than-cortexm3 With the Apollo4 being released Q2 2021, Ambiq has lowered uA/mhz from 30uA/mhz in the Apollo1 to 3uA/mhz in the Apollo4. Furthermore, Sparkfun's Artemis boards which use the Apollo3 running 6uA/mhz, use so little power than I was able to solar power the LED for an Adafruit boost charger, along with the Red and blue power LEDs on the Artemis.

Furthermore, the definition of "high-tech" and "low-tech" is due for a re-examination: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech This subject will be examined more in detail in a future analysis. 

RAM:
https://www.apmemory.com/products/psram-iot-ram/ (Density is 2MB-32MB in QSPI & OPI)

https://www.eejournal.com/industry_news/ambiq-and-ap-memory-partner-to-enable-richer-experiences-in-intelligent-endpoints/
"AP Memory solutions offer low signal pin count (6 for QSPI, 11 for OPI), low power (standby from 20µA to 80µA, active from 3mA to 8mA), and high transfer rate options needed to meet the demanding power and space constraints of wearable and other battery-powered smart consumer devices."

One approach is to run linux via external memory, using XIP:

https://www.embeddedcomputing.com/technology/storage/execute-in-place-xip-an-external-flash-architecture-ideal-for-the-code-and-performance-requirements-of-edge-iot-and-ai
of which Apollo3 has 64MB-96MB of aperture:

"The Apollo3 Blue Plus adds two additional MSPI modules (3 total), and increases the external memory execute-in-place (XiP) aperture from 64MB to 96MB (32MB/ MSPI instance). Additionally, internal flash increases from IMB to 2MB, SRAM from 384KB to 768KB (TCM size remains at 64KB) and the GPIO count increases from 50 to 74."
