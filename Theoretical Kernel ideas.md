A proposed new concept for a microkernel is to develop a suite of partial kernels that can each function as a single driver, and are rotated into RAM, for microcontrolellers with limited RAM. This could allow a "time-share" for a larger kernel that could fit into a fraction of the space. If uCLinux can use a 300KB kernel, but can only run 1 app, then a larger kernel of 3MB could be split into 12 microkernels of 256kB each. Then apps that are not used frequently can be stored on ROM, with bootloader that could allow a different app to be loaded into SRAM. the advantages to this over XiP may be if an app is going to be used for a duration, where the transfer of the entire microkernel to RAM, replacing the previous image, would be less than the runtime needs of that application. 

For example, if a user is running a text editor or a calculator app, they may not need the tcp/ip stack in the kernel while using that. modprobe and malloc could be used to remove the portions of memory address that were reserved for a driver that isn't being used. if the user is no longer using notepad/calc but wants to browse the web, the kernel can rewrite itself to fit only the components of the kernel needed to display a webpage. Whether this requires 1MB of RAM or more, is dependent on the compactness and simplicity of the browser. This concept isn't designed to accomplish a modern browser initially, but rather a DOS or early windows like operating system, which used comparable RAM sizes (Windows 3.00 used 1MB RAM) https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/sys/windows/3.00/.
